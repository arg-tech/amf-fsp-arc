Got it. And then I guess the follow-up is: you know, you mentioned looking to expand solutions to work with sellers in different ways, despite no longer doing iBuying. So I guess the question is: can you just, I guess, expand on some of those tools that you might engage with for those sellers, with this new shift in strategy? Thanks.

Yes, okay. So, we most -- you know, I don't want to say all, it's probably not all, but it's certainly most sellers in the market, even when they're at the very early stages of selling, maybe we'll call it dreaming, transitioning to selling - they show up in our apps. They look at their Zestimate. They start talking to people. They start looking at comps and consuming information. We have a -- a lot of very interesting, highly engaged touch points that -- with these customers. And we've learned a whole lot about -- of a -- transitioning that light touch into a conversation.

In doing Zillow Offers, we've learned a ton about that. And so, you know, whether the front door is through the Zestimate, or through a request for prequalification, or looking for an agent, or just wanting advice - we have a lot of ways to take a customer conversation from a kind of a shallow one to an advisory conversation.

And so -- and we look forward to being able to now refocus more broadly on that, that set of customers, rather than basically having one really -- really having the organization and all our profits from the core business focused on that one thing to sell in the store. We only have kind of one thing to sell in the store in our iBuying operation. This is going to free us up from having to think so narrowly. We think that these are still interesting solutions, but it frees us up from having to think so narrowly and we can capitalize on, you know, a broader opportunity.

Got it. Thanks.
