Thanks. Two questions. First, you're
recognizing better growth in the second quarter guide on that kind of
normalized basis excluding the better together discounts? Can you just talk
about the sustainability of the PA business, particularly into the second half
as comms get harder? What are some of the drivers behind the outlook for 2Q and
that can help in the second half? And then, secondly, you've put up the 47%
segment margin in IMT guidance implies first margins about 44%. So if full year
margins are going to be kind of flashed with last year, it implies a big step
up in the second half, can you give us a better sense of what you're investing
in? How it's going to flow across the segments? And then, what specifically
will we be weighing on IMT segment margins in the second half, given
disciplined on cost growth there for multiple years now? Thanks for your help
there.

Thanks Lloyd. That sounds like an Allen
question.

 

Allen Parker

 

Sure. Thanks, Lloyd. So on growth, yes, in
Q1 Premier Agent growth of 38% year-over-year, you know, if you compare it to
the underlying growth rates we talked about in Q4 was 27% and in Q4 2020 was
27% and in Q3 of 2020 was 20%. So we've seen this accelerating underlying
growth trend in Premiere Agent.

 

If you look in our Q2 outlook, the
underlying growth rate of 38%, at the midpoint, after you adjust for the better
together discounts, is a continuation of, you know, the inputs that we're
seeing. We have a large audience, strong top of the funnel. And when you
combine that with a focus on some of the inputs of customer satisfaction and
conversion and revenue per lead, we're just seeing very encouraging trends on
the inputs. And I think it's all, you know, predicated by this focus on helping
the customer get through the transaction.

 

In terms of the second half, we are not
providing guidance, but what I would call out is that the Premier Agent Q2, two
year growth rate of 49% that I called -- we called out in the shareholder
letter, at the midpoint of our range is probably a good way to think about
growth, as you look at your models on how to model forward through this weird
year that we had in 2020. So hopefully, that helps.

 

With respect to margin, you know in our Q2
IMT margin, we expect to be 41% at the midpoint of our outlook that is down
sequentially from the 47% in Q1. You know, as we position ourselves to drive
sustainable, profitable long-term growth, we do expect this margin rate to
reflect accelerated investments in marketing and staffing and technology to
provide innovation on behalf of the customer. And so we do expect that to
increase from Q1 levels and we expect further acceleration in Q3.

 

When I think about full year, you know,
given your question, what I'd say is, we do expect either dollar growth, but
that growth more in line with revenue growth rates, rather than expansion off
the 38% margin rate we put it in 2020. So hopefully that helps.

Yes. No, that's great. And just to clarify,
when you say kind of "a two year growth kind of consistent is a good way
to think about it", is that excluding the better together, or is that just
on headline basis?

 

Allen Parker

 

That's on a headline basis. 

 

Lloyd Walmsley

 

Got it. Alright, thank you guys.

 

Allen Parker

 

It's the 49%, if you just take Q2 2019 for
instance, Q2 2021 midpoint, that's 49% growth. And we think that's a good way
to pin your models.

 

Lloyd Walmsley

 

Ok thank you
