Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.

Mark Mahaney

Two questions, please. First, do you think that there's any change in dynamics with real estate agents? Was that at all a factor in your decision? And getting out of the Zillow Offers, would you expect that to have any impact on relations with professional real estate, you know, agents across the industry? And then secondly, just talk -- double-click on the mortgages business and the path to potential, you know, robust profitability or -- if there is a path, and how you get there? Thank you.

Rich Barton

Hey Mark. Do you want me to start, Allen?

Allen Parker

Yes.

Rich Barton

Okay. We have a really large partner network in our agents, Mark, as you -- as you know. We have helped them really -- have helped the ones who partner with us and get on with our -- get on board with our program to really drive their businesses, you know. So we've had great relationships with them. We continue to, you know. Some may see this as a sign of one thing or another. But honestly, we're really focused on innovating for customers and bringing new customer solutions to market. And as long as we're doing great things for customers, we know that partners will be there to be -- to be with us, you know. So, that's kind of how we think about that. The second part of the question, Allen, maybe?

Allen Parker

Yes, I can take that, Mark. And I guess what I'd say is that we're glad that we have, you know -- that we have the ZHL mortgage business and mortgage marketplace business. We built the factory over the last two and a half years or so, initially off of refinancing, and we showed that we can close loans on time and satisfy customers. And we have shown our ability to be profitable with enough volume.

Now, as we came into '21 and the refi volume slowed down -- you know, when the volume goes down by a certain level, we start to see this investment we're making in our loan purchase originations business show through as investment versus profit. But as shown in Q3, you know, $70 million of revenue, 32% of our funded loans were purchased; that's up 600 basis points from the quarter prior.

Now 70% of those were leads from the Zillow Offers, you know, business. That gives us comfort that financing is a very important part of the moving process and that having a financing factory that could help serve our customers in a variety of ways is a capability that we must have as we think about serving our customers as they move. And that as we get volume, we're able to generate profitability that you would expect from a purchase company -- or I should say, a mortgage origination company, as that volume grows.

So we may see a little bit of choppiness as we go into Q4 and Q1, but there's a lot of opportunities for us to present and provide our customers with, you know, pre-qualification and eventually pre-approval, and to work with our partner base in using our ZHL as the loan origination. And so we're -- you know, Rich, you can add anything, but we're excited to have this capability.

Rich Barton

That was really a thorough answer. I mean, maybe one poin... -- one, you know, one summary point, and just to remind investors that we do collect a ton of mortgage interest from consumers right now because of our way up funnel position, you know. And we process only a small portion of that ourselves with ZHL, and we have a marketplace for the balance of them, you know, that's -- this is -- this puts us in a really good position to innovate here.

Mark Mahaney

Okay. Thank you, Rich, thank you, Allen.
