Our next question comes from Brad Erickson of RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please, go ahead.

Brad Erickson

Hi, thanks. Just have a couple there. So you mentioned now a few times that you're engaging with this quarter of all buy staff last year versus market share at about 5%, I guess. Can you just give a little more color on how either, you know, MVP or Flex may be contributing there as you look to reduce that leakage and any sense of the mix between the two models?
And second, I guess a little related to the first. On the seller leads that you're looking to drive, you mentioned some that -- you've talked about, before, some of the calls to action that you're looking to implement on the site. Just curious to hear maybe a bit more about how you might serve to sort of tease out that signal of potential sellers, and any maybe early proof points as to how that's going. Thanks.

Do you want me to start with the MVP Flex transaction, Rich? 
Thanks, Brad. I'll take the first part of the question.

Rich Barton

Sorry, I was on mute, yes.

Allen Parker

That's okay. 
So, you know, I guess how I would describe it, Brad, is that we feel like we have a very strong Premier Agent partner network both across our MBP and our Flex models. You know, Flex, in and of itself, is not a driver for transactions, but it is a driver for better alignment between ourselves, our customers and our partners, we feel. And so, you know, we will continue to innovate and iterate on ways to align our partners with our products and services and our customers in ways to generate more transactions, higher conversion and more revenue per transaction. So we're very pleased with where we are, both on the MBP and Flex model. And I wouldn't call one or the other out as the biggest driver of the journey to the 2025 targets. But I think the key is alignment. And as Rich mentioned, the more integrated transaction with tools that serve our customers well and also sort of our partner network flow.

And on your second part, Brad. Look, what we what we have come to fully realize is something that, I guess, we should all intuitively understand. And that is -- I don't know if -- how to put it -- Ford, for the Super Bowl ads that they have coming up, is not going to make an advertisement that says "sell your current car", okay? What they're do -- what their marketing on the Super Bowl ad is "the dream of the new car" with the red bow on it in the driveway.
The housing equivalent of that, it holds. People -- the inspiration and aspiration of the move is the new place. The greatest seller lead opportunity we have is in helping people dream about the new house, okay? And we have a really fantastic position in that, that we're already converting into some sell-side business today. Now we also understand that solving this kind of painful but necessary part of the super app, part of the moving process, of selling your house is a big deal and having good solves for that, you know, with creative new solutions is an important area of innovation, and we are fully embracing that.

As you well know, we ran a big giant experiment with iBuying so we know a whole lot more about that now, so we'll pitch a big test over that and are innovating and working with partners to make sure we have compelling offerings to solve that particular problem.

Brad Erickson

Got it, thank you.

Rich Barton

Yes, thanks.
