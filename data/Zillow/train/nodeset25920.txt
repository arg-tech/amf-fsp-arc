Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Brent Thill

Thanks. Rich, you're blessed with a really high margin IMT business, and many have asked the sustainability of that margin profile going forward. Can you talk to what this environment does, if anything, to the margin profile of that core business as we head into 2022?

Allen Parker

Rich, do you want me to start with that and you can jump in?

Rich Barton

Yeah, please, Allen. Thank you.

Allen Parker

Yeah. So, you know, as we reported coming out of the pandemic in the second half of 2020 and then coming into the first half of 2021, we've seen margins that have been, you know, in the 46%, 47% range. I think at the midpoint of our outlook this year, 44% is our margin rate for IMT. 42% is the margin rate for this quarter.

We think the 42%, 43% margin rates are durable, tight margins. And, you know, that's with, you know, a level of investment that still allows us to do some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks in terms of touring and continuing to drive higher intent customers to high performing agents.

You know -- you know, when I look at the IMT business and I look at the growth opportunities, you know, again, we participate in a very small number of transactions. We continue to make progress on connecting these customers to high-performing agents and improving conversion and so there's a lot of opportunity for growth. We believe we can leverage that growth, which is why I feel comfortable that some of those margin rates are durable going forward.

I do think we'll reserve the right, over time, to invest because we're long-term focused, not just short-term focused. But, you know, these margin rates of 40% to 42% -- you know, in that range, I believe, are durable margin rates for this business. And I believe that the top line, as we mentioned, we believe can continue to grow faster than the industry.

Rich Barton

Well said, Allen.
