Hi thanks. So, a couple of questions. One, you know, I recognize, Rich, you've explained things in the shareholder letter, you mentioned it a few minutes ago. But, you know, people really want to understand just the mechanics maybe a bit better of what went wrong here, particularly in the bidding. So, let's start there, and then I have a follow-up.

Yes. Hey Brad, thanks for the question. We were -- fundamentally, we have been unable to predict future pricing of homes to a level of accuracy that makes this a -- you know, makes this a safe business to be in. We hadn't modeled this kind of pricing market nor supply market to even be possible when we -- when we got the business going. And, you know, we've seen all this volatility in both directions - right now in the wrong direction. And we're still at a scale that is small compared to what it needs to be.

And so as we put our minds in the state of, all right, we've got these new assumptions that we'd be na√Øve not to assume will happen again in the future, we pump them into the model and the model cranks out a business that, you know, has a high likelihood, at some point, of, you know -- you know, putting the whole company at risk, not just the business, but in the more normal case just causes a ton of volatility in earnings, which is not a great look for a public company...
You know, that's -- you know, basically, that's what it boils down to. There's capacity issues, et cetera, that we can talk about, that we've had internally and externally on the backdrop of a really tight -- tight environment. What it boils down to is our inability to have confidence in pricing in the future -- enough confidence to put our own capital at risk that we don't have to.
