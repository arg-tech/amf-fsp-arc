Our next question comes from John Colantuoni of Jefferies. John, please, go ahead.

John Colantuoni

Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start with the housing market. Maybe you could just walk us through what you're seeing today from a macro perspective and how your outlook for the housing market over the next 3 years ties into your 2025 targets. And second: you outlined plans to increase the 1.4 million homebuyers who tried to connect on Zillow last year, which is already an impressive figure. One of the initiatives you mentioned is developing asset-light seller solutions by leveraging your learnings from iBuying. Given the seller side, it's been more elusive for Zillow in the past. Can you provide any specifics around the products that you're planning to roll out that will help bolster seller connections? Thanks.

Rich Barton

Okay. Hey, John. You want me to -- Allen, I'll start with the macro stuff, and you...

Allen Parker

Sure.

Rich Barton

And maybe Brad, jump in if I get it -- if and when I get it wrong. You know, I realize that we're in a particularly interesting macro environment, given the high level of uncertainty, okay? We are well aware that it's more uncertain than usual. But our economists forecast strong macro and strong housing market this year, following up a very strong market in 2021. In fact, I think highest trends at number of transactions since 2006, Brad, am I right? Am I getting a nod?

Brad Berning

Correct, yes.

Rich Barton

All right, correct. Thank you. I don't want to get that wrong. It didn't certainly feel like that last year, did it, because inventory was so low and inventory continues to be low, but that doesn't mean there can't be a lot of transactions. And while our economists are forecasting that, we are taking -- you know, Allen and his team are certainly taking the more-uncertain-than-usual into account. What's driving the strength is this kind of millennial tide that's rising. They are really -- this demographic tide is rising on the industry and that, coupled with, you know, supply that's not rising as fast, is making this, you know, we think, continuing to be a strong, you know -- a strong market.

Did I say that okay, Allen, Brad?

Allen Parker

Yes. And I'll just add on top of that that as you mentioned, Rich, you know, our Q1 guide reflects some of that macro uncertainty that Rich talked about in the short term. The lower new sale listings, high occupancy rates and rentals and lower builder inventory are all reflective in and formed our Q1 guide. But we continue to see strong demand signals on our site and strong interest from our partners with very low churn.

And so, you know, the opportunity -- we feel well positioned as we look at this opportunity in this path to the 2025 targets to focus on the customer, improving our partner network and providing them tools. And that -- you know, we believe that the 2025 targets are appropriately aggressive but achievable through a lot of the things that we just talked about.

Just to get on the macro and how it affects our '25 targets, I just want to reiterate that, you know, our 2025 financial targets are based on flat industry transaction assumptions, so no increase in industry transactions and low single-digit HPA assumptions. So our model and the KPIs that we built really are based on our opportunity to innovate and integrate our services and drive secular growth based on the strong foundation that we have.

Rich Barton

Okay. But what Allen said about, you know, low single-digit, you know, 3% HPA home price appreciation and flat transactions -- that's not a macro call we're making. We're just -- that's just for modeling purposes. That's what we've done. So that's not our macro call. I mean, that 3% compares to what? 9% CAGR since 1971 or is that total industry? Anyway, you know.

I've got one more thing, sorry. I'd be remiss if I didn't say amidst all this macro conversation, which I understand is important for, you know, a read-through to all of our businesses in the economy, I get it. But really the big shift that we are on the leading edge of, is the shift in a giant industry, the largest perhaps in the U.S., of moving from the offline non-digital way of doing things to the online digital way of doing things with us as the leader in that. And that actually is really the most important lever and shift from a macro perspective to our long-term results.

John Colantuoni

Thank you all.

Rich Barton

Yes, thank you.
