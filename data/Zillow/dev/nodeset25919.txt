Got it, okay. Thank you. And my second question, I just want to clarify what you're saying about the overall kind of macro home price environment. So, most of the measures that are out there of CoreLogic, Case-Shiller or any of the home price indices, you know, generally, it seems to be an environment where price is still going up, albeit at a much slower pace than what had been happening. So I guess, you know, to take a step back to the macro side of things, you know, you talk a lot about the volatility and the unit margin swing. I just want to make the -- make the question: how much of that is related to, again, the forecasting side of things potentially being too optimistic versus a very volatile swing in natural prices within the broader housing market at this point? Thanks again.

It was forecast... -- forecasting volatility, Ryan. Is the short answer.

Allen Parker

Yeah, the way I would describe it, Ryan, is that as we came into the first half of the year and then into the second half and we, you know, made the decision to go ahead and grow, given our Q1 performance, we made a decision that we needed to increase our acquisition pace, and we -- and our models -- our forecasting process, I should say, at that time was not keeping up with that rapid rate of HPA increase that was occurring.

And as we went into the second half of the year, HPA still continues to increase and we believe that there's still a strong market, but the rate of increase declined significantly. So there was this volatility that Rich talked about that was way outside of the normal distribution you would expect. And that's where, you know, I think our pricing forecasting accuracy was less than we had expected. The volatility was higher, maybe another way of saying it. And so we still believe that the, you know -- and I can talk more about the write-down, but the assets are valuable, the market's still strong, but we ended up with that volatility agreeing to prices that are going to be higher than what we expect to sell those houses for less selling costs.

Understood. Thank you for the clarification. Makes sense. Thanks.
