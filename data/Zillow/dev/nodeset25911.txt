Hi, thanks. So I guess a question for
Allen. Allen, you talked about, you know, the accelerating investment across
the IMT business. So I guess, within that, there's a lot of moving parts, but
maybe just talk about how sustainable the IMT margins are feeling - certainly
through the second half of the year and then maybe beyond. And then,
separately, can you just give us any details, I guess, on how some of those
investments are being allocated here in the second half of the year? Thanks.

 

Allen Parker (corporate; Chief Financial
Officer)

Yes. Hi, Brad, thanks for the question.
Well, I'll start, you know, just to reiterate that..what we said before, we
believe the margins that we saw in the second half of 2020 and continuing into
the first half of 2021 for IMT are indicative of the inherent underlying
margins of steady state business. But we're still very early in our journey and
we see opportunities to invest into growth. We participate only in a small
percentage of transactions relative to our audience and the industry. Our Q3
outlook implies 37% EBITDA margins at the midpoint, which is down 875 basis
points sequentially. We expect our Q4 investment levels to be consistent with
Q3 factoring in that Q4 revenues do experience historically a little weaker
seasonality as compared to Q3, but fairly consistent in the Q4. I'd note that
the 37% margins are still up significantly over 2019 full year levels, which
are 23.8%, and up from our three- to five-year objectives at 30%. So while
we're increasing our investment levels in the second half of '21, we continue
to generate leverage across the segment as we've made progress, you know, even
during the pandemic. In terms of areas of investment or where we're thinking of
investing, I called out some tangible examples in my prepared remarks. You
know, the priorities we have is to drive better customer experience, broader
integrated product offerings, and continued scalability through operational
rigor and automation across the businesses. You know, it gets back to Rich's point,
you know, that the consumer is going to demand an e-commerce solution for the
industry and we're well positioned to serve that. We do expect these
investments deliver strong ROI via gross profit growth, and we believe it's
prudent, given our focus on the customer and driving transactions, to make
these investments. It's the right thing to do, to continue to invest here.
