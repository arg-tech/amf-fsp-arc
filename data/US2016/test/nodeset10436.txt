COOPER : I want to go to Dana Bash . Dana ? BASH : Governor Chafee , you were the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq war . You say Secretary Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in Iraq . She has since said that her vote was a mistake . Why is n't that good enough ? CHAFEE : Well , we just heard Senator Sanders say that it 's the worst decision in American history . That 's very significant , the worst decision in American history , I just heard from Senator Sanders . So , as we look ahead , if you 're going to make those poor judgment calls , a critical time in our history , we just finished with the Vietnam era , getting back into another quagmire — if you 're looking ahead , and you 're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq — I know because I did my homework , and , so , that 's an indication of how someone will perform in the future . And that 's what 's important . [ applause ] BASH : Secretary Clinton , he 's questioning your judgment . CLINTON : Well , I recall very well being on a debate stage , I think , about 25 times with then Senator Obama , debating this very issue . After the election , he asked me to become Secretary of State . He valued my judgment , and I spent a lot of time with him ... [ applause ] ... in the Situation Room , going over some very difficult issues . You know , I — I agree completely . We do n't want American troops on the ground in Syria . I never said that . What I said was we had to put together a coalition — in fact , something that I worked on before I left the State Department — to do , and yes , that it should include Arabs , people in the region . Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory , having more reach , and , frankly , posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond . So I think while you 're talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden , where I was one of his few advisers , or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran — I think I have a lot of evidence ... [ crosstalk ] BASH : Senator Sanders — Senator Sanders , I want to bring you in here . My question for you is , as a congressman , you voted against the Iraq War . You voted against the Gulf War . You 're just talking about Syria , but under what circumstances would a President Sanders actually use force ? SANDERS : Let me just respond to something the secretary said . First of all , she is talking about , as I understand it , a no-fly zone in Syria , which I think is a very dangerous situation . Could lead to real problems . Second of all , I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the — I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com , hear what I said in 2002 . And I say , without any joy in my heart , that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization , in fact , did happen . So I think ... BASH : All right . [ applause ] SANDERS : I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here , and that is to support those people who are against Assad , against ISIS , without getting us on the ground there , and that 's the direction I believe we should have ( inaudible ) . COOPER : But , Senator Sanders , you did n't answer the question . Under what — under what circumstances would you actually use force ? SANDERS : Well , obviously , I voted , when President Clinton said , `` let 's stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , '' I voted for that . I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan . When our country is threatened , or when our allies are threatened , I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country . I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action . ( UNKNOWN ) : You 're at work with our allies . [ crosstalk ] COOPER : I 'm gon na bring you all in on this . Governor — Governor O'Malley , Secretary Clinton ... SANDERS : I do n't believe that any ... [ crosstalk ] COOPER : Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq , supported more troops in Afghanistan . As Secretary of State , she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya . Is she too quick to use military force ? O'MALLEY : Anderson , no president — no commander in chief — should take the military option off the table , even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option . What disturbed people so much about — and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this — leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us , as a people , that there were weapons of mass destruction there was — was one of the worst blunders in modern American history . But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls . And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion . People were talking at — and saying , `` it 'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy , '' and I thought , `` has this world gone mad ? '' Whenever we go — and contrary to John Quincy Adams ' advice — `` searching the world for monsters to destroy , '' and when we use political might to take a — at the expense of democratic principle , we hurt ourselves , and we hurt our [ inaudible ] . COOPER : Does she — does she want to use military force too rapidly ? O'MALLEY : I believe that , as president , I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool . I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria , at this time , actually , Secretary , would be a mistake . You have to enforce no-fly zones , and I believe , especially with the Russian air force in the air , it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret . I support President Obama . I think we have to play a long game , and I think , ultimately — you want to talk about blunders ? I think Assad 's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder . COOPER : Governor O'Malley , just for the record , on the campaign trail , you 've been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the — for the military intervention . Senator — Secretary Clinton , you can respond . CLINTON : Well , first of all , I ... WEBB : Anderson , can I come into this discussion at some point ? COOPER : Well — yes , you 'll be coming in next , but she was directly quoted , Senator . WEBB : Thank you . I 've been standing over here for about ten minutes , trying . COOPER : OK. WEBB : It 's just — it 's gone back and forth over there . COOPER : Secretary ? CLINTON : Well , I am in the middle , here , and ... [ laughter ] Lots of things coming from all directions . WEBB : You got the lucky [ inaudible ] .CLINTON : You know , I have to say , I was very pleased when Governor O'Malley endorsed me for president in 2008 , and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign . And I consider him , obviously , a friend . Let me say — because there 's a lot of loose talk going on here — we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq . The president has made a very tough decision . What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone — which of course would be in a coalition — be put on the table is because I 'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table . You know , diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution . It 's about how you balance the risks . COOPER : Thank you . CLINTON : And I think we have an opportunity here — and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated — to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political , diplomatic solution in Syria . COOPER : Thank you , Secretary . [ crosstalk ] COOPER : Senator Webb , you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was , in your words , `` inevitable . '' Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming ? WEBB : Look , let 's start — I 've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes — let 's start with why Russia is in Syria right now . There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur . The first was the invasion of Iraq , which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran . The second was the Arab Spring , which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there . And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon , which sent bad signals , bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world . Now , I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq , whose son fought in Iraq , I 've fought in Vietnam . But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy , a focus , the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China . And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region . We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people . COOPER : Senator ... WEBB : And I would say this . I 've been waiting for 10 minutes . I will say this .
