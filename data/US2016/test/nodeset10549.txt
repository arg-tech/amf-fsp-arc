Yagoua81: Hey, as a social worker, thats awesome.
dabasegawd: See I don't mind paying a slightly higher tax IF it helps people.
suphater: Good call these create services and jobs.
desertdungarees: Well, so do police jobs. You need jailers and more prosecutors and more parole officers and more DEA agents, etc. I just want more people helping people instead of branding people as "criminals".
