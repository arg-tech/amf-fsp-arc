 Snaaaaaaaaaake:
 May not like Rubio, but I think he's winning.

 Sullyville: yeah he is the only adult in the room right now

 crispy111: Kasich is the only adult in this room. Rubio and Jeb are the

 Windover: He's hit the nail on the head on both of his answers so

 Hmmhowaboutthis: I though Kasich held his ground well on health care. Again
 don't really like him generally.
