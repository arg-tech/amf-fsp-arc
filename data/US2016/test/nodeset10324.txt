brules666: Liberal here: Rubio says the most logical stuff, too bad thats not what people want to hear. they want a crazy candidate and thats just so disappointing.
OogieBoogie1: I don't think so, I think people are starting to come around to Rubio.
Lionel-RichieTennessee: He's the only one not making me extremely angry.
FallenAerials: Kasich has said some good things about the Medicaid expansion, too. Shame he's been sidelined.
brules666: i wanted to follow him when i heard that he expanded medicaid because of St. Peter logic or whatever
patdt13: I agree. He's definitely winning the debate.
