 "How do you respond to that Bernie?"

 Respond to what?? Webb just went on a random tangent, what the fuck is he
 supposed to say to that?

 sonickarma: That's a good point.

 PopWhatMagnitude: Yeah, but it made Bernie appear to be the old guy who
 can't keep up.

 Bam515: Even when Webb's answer to Putin ended up in the south china sea,
 it made Bernie look bad.

 Duderino732: Haha Bernie went back to addressing the point before
 Webb.

 neutralID: I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so
 because, uh, some, uh, people out there in our nation don't have maps and,
 uh, I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the
 Iraq, everywhere like such as, and, I believe that they should, our education
 over here in the U.S. should help the U.S., uh, or, uh, should help South
 Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able
 to build up our future for our children.
