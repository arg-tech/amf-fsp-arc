COOPER : Secretary Clinton , how would you not be a third term of President Obama ? CLINTON : Well , I think that 's pretty obvious . I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we 've had up until this point , including President Obama . COOPER : Is there a policy difference ? CLINTON : Well , there 's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama , but also , as I 'm laying out , to go beyond . And that 's in my economic plans , how I would deal with the prescription drug companies , how I would deal with college , how I would deal with a full range of issues that I 've been talking about throughout this campaign to go further . COOPER : Senator Sanders ? SANDERS : I have a lot of respect for president Obama . I have worked with him time and time again on many , many issues . But here 's where I do disagree . I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires . [ applause ] COOPER : Senator Webb , how would you not be a third term for Obama ? WEBB : I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders , but I — Bernie , I do n't think the revolution 's going to come . And I do n't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff . And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration , it would be in the use of executive authority . I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress , used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee . I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we 're doing . So I would lead — working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets ( ph ) . COOPER : Senator Sanders , he cited you . You do n't hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution . What do you mean ? SANDERS : What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world , not one of the lowest . We need to raise public consciousness . We need the American people to know what 's going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know . [ applause ] And when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest , then we could bring the kind of change we need . O'MALLEY : Anderson , I actually have talked about a revolution . What we need is a green energy revolution . We need to move America to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way .
