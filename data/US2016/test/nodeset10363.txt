Spokker: He's telling the truth. Trump donates to Republicans and Democrats to hedge his bets. Then when he needs something, he can go to them.
SL8Rfan: I know but isn't that just an admission of the worst part of politics? I mean, I don't have any money but big oil sure does. If they wanna destroy all of the habitat of the donkey monkey wombat just to drill for oil, all they have to do is pay for it? This sounds really close to bribery.
Spokker: That's how it has worked for a long time. I doubt we even know any other way.
SL8Rfan: IT's true, I agree. But it seems like nobody is even trying to hide the fact that capitalism has ahem...trumped democracy as the rule of law in this government. Then again, the news is run by special interests and the majority of the populace enjoys being spoon fed their opinions by puffed up suits.
89million: Doesn't that make him just as corrupt as the system?
