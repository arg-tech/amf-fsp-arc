COOPER : All right . We 're going to take a short break . Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans ? That is next . We 'll be right back . [ applause ] [ commercial break ] 
COOPER : And welcome back . We are live in Nevada , in Las Vegas , at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate . The questions continue . We begin with Secretary Clinton . Secretary Clinton , you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails . For the last eight months , you have n't been able to put this issue behind you . You dismissed it ; you joked about it ; you called it a mistake . What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president ? 
CLINTON : Well , I 've taken responsibility for it . I did say it was a mistake . What I did was allowed by the State Department , but it was n't the best choice . And I have been as transparent as I know to be , turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails , asking that they be made public . And you 're right . I am going to be testifying . I 've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public , which was not originally agreed to . But let 's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee . [ applause ] It is a partisan vehicle , as admitted by the House Republican majority leader , Mr. McCarthy , to drive down my poll numbers . Big surprise . And that 's what they have attempted to do . I am still standing . I am happy to be part of this debate . [ applause ] And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people . You know , I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about , like how are we going to make college affordable ? How are we going to pay down student debt ? 
COOPER : Secretary ... CLINTON : How are we going to get health care for everybody ... [ crosstalk ] 
COOPER : Secretary Clinton , Secretary Clinton , with all due respect , it 's a little hard — I mean , is n't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue ? There 's an FBI investigation , and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue . CLINTON : Well , I never said it was n't legitimate . I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee . But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture . This committee has spent $ 4.5 million of taxpayer money , and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi would n't happen again . There were already seven committee reports about what to do . So I think it 's pretty clear what their obvious goal is . 
COOPER : Thank you . 
CLINTON : But I 'll be there . I 'll answer their questions . But tonight , I want to talk not about my e-mails , but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States . [ applause ] 
COOPER : Senator Sanders ? 
SANDERS : Let me say this . [ applause ] Let me say — let me say something that may not be great politics . But I think the secretary is right , and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails . [ applause ] 
CLINTON : Thank you . Me , too . Me , too . 
SANDERS : You know ? The middle class — Anderson , and let me say something about the media , as well . I go around the country , talk to a whole lot of people . Middle class in this country is collapsing . We have 27 million people living in poverty . We have massive wealth and income inequality . Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs . The American people want to know whether we 're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union . Enough of the e-mails . Let 's talk about the real issues facing America . [ applause ] CLINTON : Thank you , Bernie . Thank you . [ applause ] 
COOPER : It 's obviously very popular in this crowd , and it 's — hold on . [ applause ] I know that plays well in this room . But I got to be honest , Governor Chafee , for the record , on the campaign trail , you 've said a different thing . You said this is a huge issue . Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton , are you willing to say that to her face ? 
CHAFEE : Absolutely . We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , which he did n't . So there 's an issue of American credibility out there . So any time someone is running to be our leader , and a world leader , which the American president is , credibility is an issue out there with the world . And we have repair work to be done . I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president . That 's how I feel .
COOPER : Secretary Clinton , do you want to respond ? 

CLINTON : No .
