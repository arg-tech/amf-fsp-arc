 Rosie O'Donnell"

 Donald, I love you. I hate you, but I love you.

 KingDank420: I love how out of nowhere the donbot just bashes rosie for no
 reason. Fly on you crazy eagle

 [deleted]: DONBOT 2016

 gaviidae: It wasn't for no reason. Rosie was who his most obvious women
 bashing was against. The rest have been more subtle. Trump subtle so not
 normal subtle.

 ShasOFish: So, billboard level for everyone else?

 DrunkenJagFan: You know, I ain't even mad.

 [deleted]: Can you imagine any other politician on any side saying
 something like that? This guy is hysterical

 zeptimius: I also love how Megyn Kelly butts in "Not just her"
 suggesting it would have been OK if it had been all about Rosie O'Donnell.
