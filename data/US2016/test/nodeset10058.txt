 This debate has honestly been making me uncomfortable, its been way too
 hostile. Its like listening to mom and dad fight in the kitchen while your
 hide under the covers in your room. If all they succeed at is making the
 entire panel seem unlikable, the democratic nominee will be bleeding votes no
 matter who wins

 LurkerPatrol: Aka a debate....

 bringmethesampo: I agree. CNN and Anderson Cooper are horseshit.

 Elmattador: you must have missed the GOP debates.

 Bigtwinkie: Respectfully disagree, the GOP debates were a lot of fluff. I
 guess that's what happens when your leading candidate its calling people fat
 and ugly and just being silly

 PM_ME_YOUR_CEVICHE: Yeah it got chippy, but only when Hillary chimes in
 (her responses seem to be targeted to make Bernie look bad). I really think
 everyone is being incredibly respectful, even when they disagree with each
 other.
