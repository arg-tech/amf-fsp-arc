 I am really sad to see all these "Hillary is killing it" comments
 when most of what she said has been fluff and targeted rhetoric (redundant
 for me to say but there are people here who don't know what rhetoric
 means)

 I hope the next hour changes that. I want to see a factual Hillary going
 in, not this one that is trying to be the High School president by talking
 over others and barely saying anyting other than empty promises

 [deleted]: she's staying above the noise, which is all she has to do with a
 30% lead in the polls.

 foreverburning: Same reason she's getting tons of cheers for literally NO
 REASON. People just want to be a part of history in getting the first woman
 elected president.

 [deleted]: what? Sanders has just been full of platitudes with no
 specifics. If anything, Hillary actually has specifics, names names,
 etc.

 [deleted]: I said nothing about sanders in this. Take off your hilldawg
 glasses
