 zoomski: Can someone explain to me why someone who
 believes that all lives matter is offensive? Why is it that black lives
 matter, but not everyone else?

 NEMESIS94: The notion that black lives are at much more risk and much more
 threatened than other American lives and we're just ignoring it

 zoomski: I definitely understand that, but I guess I don't understand why I
 (a 20 something, white male) am deemed a shitlord and a racist because I
 believe every life matters and do not support the #blacklivesmatter
 movement.

 NEMESIS94: Because there are idiots
 in BLM just like there are in every other group in the world. BLM being an
 ideological extreme doesn't help either.

 zoomski: Sad times we live in.

 Her0_0f_time: No fucking clue. Black lives do matter. No one is arguing
 that except for racists.

 BreweryInTheSky: It's because all lives matter is the point of black lives
 matter. Black lives are valued less than the lives of other races. It's a
 real problem. To bring attention to that problem, we say Black Lives Matter.
 All lives matter does not bring attention to the problem.
