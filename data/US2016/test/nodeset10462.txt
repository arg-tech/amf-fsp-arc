WALLACE : Governor Walker . [ applause ] Governor Walker , when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010 , you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term , first four years . In fact , Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth . Now you 're running for president , and you 're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream . Given your record in Wisconsin , why should voters believe you ? 

WALKER : Well , the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high , not aimed low . Before I came in , the unemployment rate was over eight percent . It 's now down to 4.6 percent . We 've more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession . And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally . You know , people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington . One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington , D.C.. I think most of us in America understand that people , not the government creates jobs . And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way , repeal Obamacare , put in -- reign in all the out of control regulations , put in place an all of the above energy policy , give people the education , the skills that the need to succeed , and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code . That 's what I 'll do as president , just like I did in Wisconsin . [ applause ]
