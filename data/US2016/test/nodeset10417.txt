That's the thing the left ignores when Rubio, and others like him, talk about obamacare. Consistently, he talks about "repeal and replace." The last two words are often left out. Conservatives don't think there should be no public healthcare, they think it should be efficient, and basic. It shouldn't be a life support, it should be a stepping stone to getting better healthcare.

I'd be absolutely fine with hearing that argument if we ever get concrete ideas about what "replacing" would look like.

But none of those dickweeds actually come up with any ideas.

Conservatives also never have a good answer for what that 'replace' is

Fair. But when universal healthcare is in the national debate, the republicans haven't been in a place of power for negotiating.
