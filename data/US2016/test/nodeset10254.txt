 Hillary, what info that Snowden stole fell into what wrong hands?

 Zero evidence of that, that I know of.

 classified.

 grayk47: Actually the New York Times released some documents released by
 Snowden that were supposed to be redacted by the Times before publishing the
 papers. However those papers were not properly redacted and people were
 simply able to delete the redactions. These papers delay with operations
 against Al-Qaeda, and unfortunately Al-Qaeda was able to look at these papers
 and operations that were supposed to be redacted. That by itself makes
 Snowden guilty under the 1917 Espionage Act.

 Edit: here's the source

 telperiontree: Seems more like the NYT should be held responsible for
 that?

 grayk47: Think of it this way, when you give an illegally (as in you stole
 it) acquired firearm to a friend to use responsibly, then that person
 accidentally shoots someone, who should be blamed. Both should be held
 responsible. This is the same case for Snowden, he gave illegally acquired
 papers that he stole, to the Times in the hopes that they would responsible with
 it. They failed in that and a terrorist group was able to use the exposed
 information to alter their plans. It's cut and dry.
