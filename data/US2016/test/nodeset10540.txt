Siege-Torpedo: With his bigly sentences?
BeerFarts86: Don't be a simpleton.
Siege-Torpedo: I'm not the guy supporting a man who can't string two complete sentences together.
BeerFarts86: I'm not a trump supporter. I hate him. But i don't suck Hillary's cock either. He would make a horrible president, I don't think she'll be much better. Just making an observation.
Siege-Torpedo: Yeah I'm probably going nuts, I'm really drunk righ now. Very sorry for going shitposting, I understand your position on both candidates being poor.
BeerFarts86: It's all good man. We're all in this together. Cheers! Here's to surviving to 2020.
exwasstalking: Yelling is winning? All he has said he is going to do is lower taxes and deregulate businesses. Throw in some shouting and name calling.
