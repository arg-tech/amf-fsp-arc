WALLACE : Mr. Trump , you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy , I want to ask you about your business records . From corporations , Trump corporations , casinos and hotels , have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.

UNKNOWN : ... In 2011 , you told Forbes Magazine this : `` I 've used the laws of the country to my advantage . '' But at the same time , financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.Question sir , with that record , why should we trust you to run the nation 's business ? 

TRUMP : Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws , to do a great job for my company , for myself , for my employees , for my family , et cetera.I have never gone bankrupt, by the way . I have never.But out of hundreds of deals ... 

WALLACE : No , but the concept sir ... 

TRUMP : Excuse me . Excuse me.

WALLACE : ... that 's your line , but your companies have gone bankrupt.

TRUMP : Excuse me , what am I saying ? Out of hundreds of deals that I 've done , hundreds , on four occasions I 've taken advantage of the laws of this country , like other people . I'm not going to name their names because I'm not going to embarrass , but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections , they 've used the law.The difference is , when somebody else uses those laws , nobody writes about it . When I use it , they say , `` Trump , Trump , Trump . '' The fact is , I built a net worth of more than $ 10 billion . I have a great , great company . I employ thousands of people . And I'm very proud of the job I did. Again Chris , hundreds and hundreds of deals . Four times , I 've taken advantage of the laws . And frankly , so has everybody else in my position.

WALLACE : Well sir , let's just talk about the latest example ... [ applause ] ... which is Trump Entertainment Resorts , which went bankrupt in 2009 . In that case alone , lenders to your company lost over $ 1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off.TRUMP : Well , I ... 

WALLACE : Is that the way that you'd run the country ? 

TRUMP : Let me just tell you about the lenders . First of all , these lenders are n't babies . These are total killers . These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK ? [ laughter and applause ] You know , I mean you're living in a world of the make-believe, Chris , you want to know the truth . [ applause ] And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City , which by the way , Caesars just went bankrupt . Every company , Chris can tell you , every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt . [ laughter ] Every company.And let me just tell you . I had the good sense, and I've gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages , seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered , and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City , and I 'm very proud of it . I want to tell you that . Very , very proud of it.WALLACE : So ... TRUMP : And by the way , this country right now owes $ 19 trillion . And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess . [ applause ] 
WALLACE : Senator Rubio . Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook . And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia . Here she is . [ begin video clip ] 
QUESTION : Please describe one action you would do to make the economic environment more favorable for small businesses and entrepreneurs and anyone dreaming of opening their own business . [ close video clip ] RUBIO : That 's a great question.
WALLACE : Senator , how do you answer Tania ? 
RUBIO : That's a great question. First of all , it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago . It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.Now , the big companies that have connections with Washington , they can affect policies to help them , but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about , they're the ones that are struggling.The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent , just as we need to lower it for all businesses.We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy . We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.And last but not least , we need to repeal Dodd-Frank . It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks . [ applause ] 20  over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the  since Dodd-Frank has passed . We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank . We need to make America fair again for all businesses , but especially those being run by small business owners.
WALLACE : Senator Rubio , thank you . [ applause ] 
BAIER : Gentlemen , another question for a few of you. Yesterday, just yesterday , President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal , calling them knee-jerk partisans , adding that hardliners in Iran who chant `` death to America '' were , quote , `` making common cause with the Republican caucus . '' Here's what two of your opponents on the 5 p.m. debate stage said about Iran . [ video clip begins ] 
PERRY : I will tell you one thing : I would whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry . Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away . But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no , but hell no , to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror ... [ video clip ends ] [ video clip begins ] 
FIORINA : When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place . This is a bad deal . Obama broke every rule of negotiation . Yes , our allies are not perfect , but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy . [ video clip ends ] 
BAIER : Now , I wanna ask a few of you this . First , Governor Walker . You 've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one . If this deal is undone , what then ? WALKER : Well , first off , let 's remember . I still remember , as a kid , tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage . Iran is not a place we should be doing business with . To me , you terminate the deal on day one , you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress , you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place , and then you convince our allies to do the same . This is not just bad with Iran , this is bad with ISIS . It is tied together , and , once and for all , we need a leader who 's gon na stand up and do something about it . It 's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine . [ applause ] 
BAIER : Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one ? 
PAUL : I oppose the Iranian deal , and will vote against it . I don't think that the president negotiated from a position of strength , but I don't immediately discount negotiations . I'm a Reagan conservative . Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets . But you have to negotiate from a position of strength , and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early . If there 's going to be a negotiation , you 're going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply . And I asked this question to John Kerry , I said `` do you believe they 're trustworthy ? '' and he said `` No . '' And I said , `` well , how are we gonna get them to comply ? '' I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance . BAIER : Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said ? HUCKABEE : Ronald Reagan said `` trust , but verify . '' President Obama is `` trust , but vilify . '' He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him . And the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party . [ applause ] [ crosstalk ] HUCKABEE : It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gon na be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing . We didn't even get four hostages out . We got nothing , and Iran gets everything they want . We said we would have anywhere , anytime negotiations and inspections , we gave that up . We said that we would make sure that they didn't have any nuclear capacity , we gave that up . The president can't tell us what we got . I 'll tell you what the world got . The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn't , as the Soviets , say `` we might defend ourselves in a war . '' What the Iranians have said is , `` we will wipe Israel off the face of the map , and we will bring death to America . '' When someone points a gun at your head [ timer sounds ] and loads it , by God , you ought to take them seriously , and we need to take that seriously . BAIER : Thank you , gentlemen . KELLY : Well , the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out . Stick around . Social issues , next . [ commercial break ]
