COOPER : Thanks , sir . WEBB : And I put the African American soldier on the Mall . I made that recommendation and fought for it . So , if you want someone who is — can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job , I have taken the risks , I am your person . COOPER : Senator Sanders , let 's talk about income inequality . Wages and incomes are flat . You 've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s . We 've had a Democratic president for seven years . What are you going to be able to do that President Obama did n't ? 
SANDERS : Well , first of all , let 's remember where we were when Bush left office . We were losing 800,000 jobs a month . And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue , but the world 's financial crisis was on — the world 's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse . That 's where we were . Are we better off today than we were then ? Absolutely . But the truth is that for the 40 years , the great middle class of this country has been disappearing . And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure ; raise the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour ; pay equity for women workers ; and our disastrous trade policies , which have cost us millions of jobs ; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free . [ applause ] 
COOPER : Secretary Clinton ... [ crosstalk ] COOPER : I 'll let you jump in a moment . Everybody will get in on this in a moment . Secretary Clinton , how would you address this issue ? In all candor , you and your husband are part of the one percent . How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class ? 
CLINTON : Well , you know , both Bill and I have been very blessed . Neither of us came from wealthy families and we 've worked really hard our entire lives . And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had , to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education , good job training , and then good jobs . I have a five point economic plan , because this inequality challenge we face , we have faced it at other points . It 's absolutely right . It has n't been this bad since the 1920s . But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy , there is no comparison . The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that 's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017. 
COOPER : Governor O'Malley , ( inaudible ) . 
O'MALLEY : Yes . Anderson , I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned , and I actually did them in our state . We raised the minimum wage , passed the living wage , invested more in infrastructure , went four years in a row without a penny 's increase in college tuition . But there 's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight , but he 's been excellent about underscoring that . And that is that we need to separate the casino , speculative , mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money , from the commercial banking — namely , reinstating Glass-Steagall . Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago . And Secretary , I was proud to support you eight years ago , but something happened in between , and that is , Anderson , a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families . And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today . We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that 's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates . 
COOPER : Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this , Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities . Secretary Clinton , he raises a fundamental difference on this stage . Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks . You don't . You say charge the banks more , continue to monitor them . Why is your plan better ? 
CLINTON : Well , my plan is more comprehensive . And frankly , it 's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail . We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw . But we also have to worry about some of the other players — AIG , a big insurance company ; Lehman Brothers , an investment bank . There's this whole area called ``shadow banking . '' That 's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from. CLINTON : So I 'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks . And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk . But I want to make sure we 're going to cover everybody , not what caused the problem last time , but what could cause it next time . [ crosstalk ] 
COOPER : Senator Sanders , Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours . 
SANDERS : Well , that 's not true . [ laughter ] 
COOPER : Why ? 
SANDERS : Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people . [ applause ] Check the record . In the 1990s — and all due respect — in the 1990s , when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying , when the Clinton administration , when Alan Greenspan said , `` what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge , '' Bernie Sanders fought them , and helped lead the opposition to deregulation . [ applause ] Today , it is my view that when you have the three ...
