 XxEnder_GamerxX: Am I the only one who noticed that Bernie
 combed his hair?

 MR_TELEVOID: Maybe you're just the only one who gives a shit about their
 hair.

 XxEnder_GamerxX: No, Bernie is famous for never combing his hair.

 MR_TELEVOID: Haha. Actually, Bernie Sanders is famous for a lot more than
 his hair. The media is famous for distracting us with superficial bullshit
 like his unkempt hair.

 XxEnder_GamerxX: Don't you worry, I am very politically informed. It's just
 a fun little thing I noticed.

 MR_TELEVOID: More little than fun, I'd say. You have fun with yourself tho.
 Don't ever let your irrelevancy get you down.
