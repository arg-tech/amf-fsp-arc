Faoeoa: Is God Really Fair?
We rate this mostly false.
LicenseToILL-INI: I'll be hitting F5 on Politifact like it's the NBA offseason.
brent0935: I really hope that they put up a picture of Trump with burning pants on his head, and that's all they say about him.
atetuna: So much overtime...
Chinchillacious: Politifact checkers are snorting adderall and taking espresso body shots.
brent0935: Id just shoot myself at this point
Redditor_exe: I believe I heard one of the candidate talking about how we are weak militarily and we need to spend a lot more money on it. You know despite the fact we have the largest and most technologically advanced Navy in the world (more Aircraft Carriers than the rest of the world combined, all of them about 2x as big as the rest of the worlds').
I also believe that I read somewhere that if you were to rank the Top 10 Air Forces in the world it goes a little something like:
U.S. Air Force
U.S. Navy
Russia
China
U.S. Army (may not be totally right in terms of order, but it is true that the U.S. has 3 of the top 10 air forces in the world)
Teh_Slayur: I'm pretty sure I heard Christie claim that 70% of spending is on entitlements. WHAAAAAAATTTT? 40% of spending is the military alone. Math doesn't check out. Furthermore, Social Security is a self-sustaining, non-discretionary program. The discretionary budget is the relevant portion, and 60% of it is the military!
