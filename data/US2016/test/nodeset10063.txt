 RandizzleDee: Eli5 Clinton Benghazi scandal?

 exitpursuedbybear: Derp herp derp herp!

 Xelnastoss: Terror attack on embassy in middle east hillary was secretary
 of state possibly knew about it then lied and said it wasn't terror then lied
 to say it is now no one knows.

 Also turns out the committee to figure out what happens only goal was to
 hurt hillary which ironically knowing that makes her stronger

 RandizzleDee: Thanks for the response, if she did lie, what reasons are
 people giving to show that she benefited from lying?

 Xelnastoss: It's that she lied about
 the attack for a long period of time and withheld information from the Senate
 I think

 In the end it's a bit of a convoluted issue the main attack is she must
 hate our troops for lying about it because they could of buffed
 security

 Also hit reddit a bit cause the ambassador turned out to be a guy in the
 eve corporation on reddit
