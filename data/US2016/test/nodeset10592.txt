This dudes english and grammar level is below high school. I hate how he speaks like a 15 year old. He cant even sound smart if he tries. Damn

But he has the best words.

Thats insulting to a 15 year old. I would put him at 10 years old.

He is appealing to every level of American. There is a reason why he speaks this way.

And he happens to be tied in some states. Sometimes sounding smart doesn't win elections. Ask Mitt Romney...



dontbeamaybe 

he's completely incapable of understanding the basics of how logic works
