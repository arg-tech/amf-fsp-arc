 ESP16:
 Hillary loves to talk, and talk, and talk; what will she DO?

 Teekey: She will do things. She has plans and stuff.

 In the beginning she said how she was going to go into specifics, and she's
 done anything but.

 chormin: Talk?

 torgo_phylum: It's a debate...I mean...what do you...talking is what you do
 here. She is the only candidate who has put forth comprehensive plans on
 these issues. You want to know what she'll do? It's all on her website.

 To be clear I prefer sanders. But this vilification of Hillary is just
 groupthink and illiterate.

 ESP16: I certainly wouldn't consider myself a member of the Sanders
 circlejerk (though I do support him on many points ). I just hate listening to politicians, Bernie included, speak in
 hypotheticals and rhetoric rather than actual plans.
