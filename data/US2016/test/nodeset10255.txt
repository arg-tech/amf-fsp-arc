 Reddit is not going to be happy Bernie wants to throw Snowden in the
 slammer.

 Jokrtothethief: That's not what he said.

 Atraktape: What does that mean then? Fines? Parole? Washing police cars on
 the weekends?

 Jokrtothethief: I dunno.

 eaglessoar: I don't think anyone denies he broke some laws, everyone just
 knows he wouldn't get fair treatment in court.

 ncolaros: They'll ignore it.

 JZer86: He didn't say that. He said Snowden broke the law, but the civil
 liberty violations that were discovered because of it should be taken into
 consideration. If there's jail time it would be minimal.

 mud074: It makes logical sense though. You can't just make exceptions to
 laws because it was justified.
