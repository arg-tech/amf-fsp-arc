shadowofahelicopter: Sanders has had an absolute terrible showing, possibly the worst one up there. Not that his ideas are bad, but he's been terrible at presenting anything and responding to others without sounding crazy and out of touch on the left end of the spectrum. Hillary is the only one up there not stuttering and giving poised responses which is quite sad because no one wants Clinton. I consider myself pretty moderate and I was hoping there's be something here after not having anything on the republican side. I just really want to vote for anyone but Clinton and Bernie sanders just isn't that guy.
Teekey:
 There is no way Sanders has done worse than Chafee.

 shadowofahelicopter: Yea that's true and he's done a lot better in the last
 twenty minutes. They're all doing fairly well now and seem like they're all
 just working off each other having fun up there. It's amazing how unified the
 Democratic Party is compared to the republicans.

 Helicase21: The biggest issue for Sanders is that expectations for him were
 really high. Remember how people thought that having fewer debates was going
 to be a massive advantage for Hillary? I'm afraid it ain't so.

 Tuatho: If you're basing your political opinion based on which speaker is
 smoother and not based on a plethora of political issues, you shouldn't be
 fucking voting. I'm aware I'm railing against a brick wall here, but I'm even
 more willing to vote for Sanders because he doesn't sound like a used car
 salesman and rather speaks about issues.

 shadowofahelicopter: I've done heavy research on Bernie before the debate.
 He's too far left for me. It's not how he's debating that's turning me away,
 but I think it will turn a lot of people away. With that said he's completely
 turned it around in the last twenty minutes, but he's got a lot to make up
 for his slow rough start.
