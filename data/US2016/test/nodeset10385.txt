wfa19: I think Paul or Rubio would have a good chance.
FallenAerials: Rubio is the only one that really worries me. I don't think he'll be at the top of the ticket, but I'd put money on him being the veep candidate.
google1971genocide: Not really, a lot of them radiate huge alpha confidence.
They would eat clinton for breakfast. Clinton may have better plans etc. but you have to hand to the republicans they are a confident bunch.
Exist50: Without her screwing up, that is.
The1andonlyZackIllinois: Shhh, it's always way more fun when they are convinced they are a shoe-in to win when they are totally fucked. (See 2008 and 2012)
FallenAerials: If by competent, you mean they're like a 3 year old trying to understand calculus, then yes.
