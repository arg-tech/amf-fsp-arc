Polskan: Trump feeds off of ridiculous questions. Without ridiculous questions he may not be where he is today.
DeceitFive9: Good point. I just feel like he's being attacked. Let him speak. Let him talk about the issues he feels are important.
PM_ME_INSIDER_INFO: You're supporting Trump here?
DeceitFive9: No, I want him to bring up important issues like he has been. He strikes a nerve with alot of Americans. I don't want him to be president.
edit: I want to see him debate these puppet politicians.. He isn't 100% genuine.. but he's a hell of alot more sincere than most of the candidates.
shung: Yelling rhetoric and buzz words is all he knows how to do though. Notice how any actual solutions he comes up with are just plain stupid. Build a giant wall on the border to solve the illegal immigrant problem? That's the best solution?
DeceitFive9: To be fair, He(or anyone) didn't have that much time to respond.. but lets real, in beginning of the debate he mentioned that no one would be bringing it up if he didn't say anything and he's right.
LumpyArryhead: Right cuz immigration definitely hasn't been a hot button issue for a couple decades or anything.
