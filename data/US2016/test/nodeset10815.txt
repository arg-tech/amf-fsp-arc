COOPER: Governor — Governor... [applause] 
Governor O'Malley... [applause] 
Governor, it's popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers. 
Governor O'Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, "being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal." 
You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight? 
O'MALLEY: I believe that now that we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long — what the FBI's asking about. Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues. Which is why — and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table. 
We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable... 
COOPER: ...Thank you, governor. 
O'MALLEY: ...we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050. 
COOPER: I want to talk about issues of race in America, for that I want to start of with Don Lemon. 
LEMON: Alright, Anderson, thank you very much. I'm not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail. Can you hear me? 
Can't hear me in the room. OK, here we go again, as I said... 
WILKINS: ...law school. My question for the candidates is, do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? 
COOPER: The question from Arthur... 
LEMON: ...There we go... 
COOPER: ...Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter? Let's put that question to Senator Sanders. 
SANDERS: Black lives matter. [cheering] And the reason — the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she's going to end up dead in jail, or their kids are going to get shot. We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system In which we have more people in jail than China. And, I intended to tackle that issue. To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells. [applause] 
COOPER: Governor O'Malley, the question from Arthur was do black lives matter , or do all lives matter ? 
O'MALLEY: Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color. 
When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore — and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction. 
Black lives matter , and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country. [applause] 
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't? 
CLINTON: Well, I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn, so... [applause] ...So, what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice — I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing. There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on. 
Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world. 
But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we've got to do more about the lives of these children. That's why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential. That is... 
COOPER: ...Thank you, Senator... 
CLINTON: ...really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education... 
COOPER: Senator... 
CLINTON: ...if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people, or good housing, there's a long list... [applause] ...We need a new New Deal for communities of color... 
COOPER: Senator Webb? 
WEBB: I hope I can get that kind of time here. As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters. At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans. 
We're talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide. 
We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in. 
I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded — who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years. He took his life three years into this. I cleared his name after — after three years.
