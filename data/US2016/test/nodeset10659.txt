That's ridiculous.

No its tremendous

Don't they tend to audit people both randomly and when there are problems? I can't expect there to be random audits ever year so there must be a problem each year right?

I would think that if you have really complicated taxes you would be a lot more susceptible to audits than the average person. I'm no expert though.

He just said he doesnt pay anything... "because I am smart"

Trump's ego fell right into Clinton's trap.

People who make a lot or write off a lot of losses tend to get audited. The IRS doesn't have the manpower for random audits.

I thought he was trying to make it out that he was being targeted.
