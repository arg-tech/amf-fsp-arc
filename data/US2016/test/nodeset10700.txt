HOLT : We have just ... 

TRUMP : ... where they 're not paying us what we need.
HOLT : We have just a few final questions ... TRUMP : And she does n't say that , because she 's got no business ability . We need heart . We need a lot of things . But you have to have some basic ability . And sadly , she does n't have that . All of the things that she 's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years , let 's say , while she had great power . But they were n't taken care of . And if she ever wins this race , they wo n't be taken care of.
HOLT : Mr. Trump , this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party . Earlier this month , you said she does n't have , quote , `` a presidential look . '' She 's standing here right now . What did you mean by that ? 
TRUMP : She does n't have the look . She does n't have the stamina . I said she does n't have the stamina . And I do n't believe she does have the stamina . To be president of this country , you need tremendous stamina.
HOLT : The quote was , `` I just do n't think she has the presidential look . `` 
TRUMP : You have—wait a minute . Wait a minute , Lester . You asked me a question . Did you ask me a question ? You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals . You have to be able to negotiate , that 's right , with Japan , with Saudi Arabia . I mean , can you imagine , we 're defending Saudi Arabia ? And with all of the money they have , we 're defending them , and they 're not paying ? All you have to do is speak to them . Wait . You have so many different things you have to be able to do , and I do n't believe that Hillary has the stamina.
HOLT : Let 's let her respond . 
CLINTON : Well , as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal , a cease-fire , a release of dissidents , an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world , or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee , he can talk to me about stamina . [ applause ] 
TRUMP : The world—let me tell you . Let me tell you . Hillary has experience , but it 's bad experience . We have made so many bad deals during the last—so she 's got experience , that I agree . [ applause ] But it 's bad , bad experience . Whether it 's the Iran deal that you 're so in love with , where we gave them $ 150 billion back , whether it 's the Iran deal , whether it 's anything you can—name—you almost ca n't name a good deal . I agree . She 's got experience , but it 's bad experience . And this country ca n't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.

HOLT : We are at—we are at the final question . [ applause ] 

CLINTON : Well , one thing . One thing , Lester.

HOLT : Very quickly , because we 're at the final question now.

CLINTON : You know , he tried to switch from looks to stamina . But this is a man who has called women pigs , slobs and dogs , and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers , who has said ... 

TRUMP : I never said that. 

CLINTON : ... . women do n't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.

TRUMP : I did n't say that.

CLINTON : And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest . He loves beauty contests , supporting them and hanging around them . And he called this woman `` Miss Piggy . '' Then he called her `` Miss Housekeeping , '' because she was Latina . Donald , she has a name.

TRUMP : Where did you find this ? Where did you find this ? 

CLINTON : Her name is Alicia Machado.

TRUMP : Where did you find this ? 

CLINTON : And she has become a U.S. citizen , and you can bet ... 

TRUMP : Oh , really ? 

CLINTON : ... she 's going to vote this November.

TRUMP : OK , good . Let me just tell you ... [ applause ]
