 Jeb Bush called himself "Veto Corleone." Everyone drink.

 trevbot: And then two questions later said he didn't read every line item
 so whatever they were talking about got passed, cause he didn't see it...

 at some charity. Not to when he was holding office.

 AsthmaticMechanic: Listening comprehension is not required.

 madreofdragons: Favorite moment ever.
