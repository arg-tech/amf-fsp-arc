 fauxromanou: Thanks dude!

 GeeBeeH: which is cool and but i dont care. We want to keep hearing about
 how much they suck.

 GetBorn800: Do you think that arguing "the other side is bad" is
 actually helpful for our political system?

 fauxromanou: I think it's helpful to reiterate that even if we differ on
 whether we support Sanders, Clinton, or 'other' that they're all more
 cohesive and reasonable than the other side. Evidenced by this debate being
 mostly about policy (whether they tip toe around some issues or not) and the
 absolutely brilliant move to disregard the email scandal by Sanders.

 Velvetrose: Happy Cake Day

 fauxromanou: Thanks a lot!
