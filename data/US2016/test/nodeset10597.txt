The only people who win tonight are the media moguls by accumulating ratings for this pile of crap. It's not entertaining. Just stop watching. They are both unfit for the office.

 They are both unfit for the office.

Is that the line Trumpeters are taking now?

Honestly this is what confuses me about this election. Sure, she is far from a perfect candidate, but how can you say they are equally unfit? One is quantifiably more fit than the other. I mean you dont have to agree with her positions, but she is objectively more qualified than he is.

She knowingly mishandled classified information. My job gives me the responsibility of looking at top secret information because I hold a security clearance. If I sent it on a private email server I'd be in jail for twenty years. Yet she is in charge of the state department and walks away without a scratch.

As a foreword, they teach you in security briefings to not advertise your access to classified information, so I wouldn't if I were you.

I agree with you that the entirety of the email scandal is a huge blackspot on her campaign, but where I feel like I disagree with you is the fact that, despite her major lapse in judgment, that blackspot does not even come close to the negatives of a potential Trump Presidency. He lacks a fundamental intellectual curiosity necessary for the job. He doesn't seem interested in governing, and the policies he does put forth are either woefully lacking in details or decided against American interests. His racist and demagogic statements alone are enough to show that he is not ready or capable for the job.

Ninja Edit: And lastly, after watching the debate, If the man can't prepare for a 90-minute debate, then what makes anyone think he will be prepared for 4 years.
