HOLT : Mr. Trump , for five years , you perpetuated a false claim that the nation 's first black president was not a natural-born citizen . You questioned his legitimacy . In the last couple of weeks , you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years : The president was born in the United States . Can you tell us what took you so long ? 

TRUMP : I 'll tell you very—well , just very simple to say . Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close—very close friend of Secretary Clinton . And her campaign manager , Patti Doyle , went to—during the campaign , her campaign against President Obama , fought very hard . And you can go look it up , and you can check it out.And if you look at CNN this past week , Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened . Blumenthal sent McClatchy , highly respected reporter at McClatchy , to Kenya to find out about it . They were pressing it very hard . She failed to get the birth certificate.When I got involved , I did n't fail . I got him to give the birth certificate . So I 'm satisfied with it . And I 'll tell you why I 'm satisfied with it.

HOLT : That was ... [ crosstalk ] 

TRUMP : Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS , because I want to get on to creating jobs , because I want to get on to having a strong border , because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.

HOLT : I will let you respond . It 's important . But I just want to get the answer here . The birth certificate was produced in 2011 . You 've continued to tell the story and question the president 's legitimacy in 2012 , '13 , '14 , '15 ... 

TRUMP : Yeah.

HOLT : ... . as recently as January . So the question is , what changed your mind ? 

TRUMP : Well , nobody was pressing it , nobody was caring much about it . I figured you 'd ask the question tonight , of course . But nobody was caring much about it . But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate . And I think I did a good job.Secretary Clinton also fought it . I mean , you know—now , everybody in mainstream is going to say , oh , that 's not true . Look , it 's true . Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter—you just have to take a look at CNN , the last week , the interview with your former campaign manager . And she was involved . But just like she ca n't bring back jobs , she ca n't produce.

HOLT : I 'm sorry . I 'm just going to follow up—and I will let you respond to that , because there 's a lot there . But we 're talking about racial healing in this segment . What do you say to Americans , people of color who ... [ crosstalk ] 

TRUMP : Well , it was very—I say nothing . I say nothing , because I was able to get him to produce it . He should have produced it a long time before . I say nothing.But let me just tell you . When you talk about healing , I think that I 've developed very , very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community . I think you can see that.And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion . And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country , but even for the president , in getting him to produce his birth certificate.

HOLT : Secretary Clinton ? 

CLINTON : Well , just listen to what you heard . [ laughter ] And clearly , as Donald just admitted , he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage , and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions , so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.But it ca n't be dismissed that easily . He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen . There was absolutely no evidence for it , but he persisted , he persisted year after year , because some of his supporters , people that he was trying to bring into his fold , apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.But , remember , Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans , and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy . He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior . And the birther lie was a very hurtful one . You know , Barack Obama is a man of great dignity . And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention : When they go low , we go high . And Barack Obama went high , despite Donald Trump 's best efforts to bring him down.

HOLT : Mr. Trump , you can respond and we 're going to move on to the next segment.

TRUMP : I would love to respond . First of all , I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama . You treated him with terrible disrespect . And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are . It does n't work that way . You were after him , you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures . I do n't think you can deny that.But just last week , your campaign manager said it was true . So when you tried to act holier than thou , it really does n't work . It really doesn't.Now , as far as the lawsuit , yes , when I was very young , I went into my father 's company , had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens , and we , along with many , many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued . We settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt . It was very easy to do.I notice you bring that up a lot . And , you know , I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways , which I do n't do on you . Maybe I 'm trying to save the money.But , frankly , I look—I look at that , and I say , is n't that amazing ? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt , but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms , and it 's just one of those things.I 'll go one step further . In Palm Beach , Florida , tough community , a brilliant community , a wealthy community , probably the wealthiest community there is in the world , I opened a club , and really got great credit for it .
