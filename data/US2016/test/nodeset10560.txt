But isn't settling admitting wrongdoing?

It can cost more to fight a lawsuit to prove your innocence than to just settle with no admission of wrong-doing. Not saying that's what happened in Trump's case though.

Thank you for clarifying for me

technically no...that's part of the settlement agreement. Pay hush money and technically people have to shut up about it and you don't take blame.

Depends on the agreement. His specified that they weren't.
