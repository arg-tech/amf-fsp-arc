COOPER: And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate. 
This is a question to each of you. Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make. Each of you will have 90 seconds. But a final question to each of you. If you can, just try to â€” 15 seconds if you can. 
Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made." You've all made a few people upset over your political careers. Which enemy are you most proud of? [laughter]
CHAFEE: I guess the coal lobby. I've worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby. But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide. I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby. 
COOPER: Governor O'Malley? 
O'MALLEY: The National Rifle Association. [applause] 
COOPER: Secretary Clinton? 
CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. [laughter]
Probably the Republicans. [laughter and applause] 
COOPER: Senator Sanders? 
SANDERS: As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me. [applause] 
COOPER: Senator Webb? 
WEBB: I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.
