 Do you think that Fox News executives and the RNC told the moderators to
 hammer Trump?

 tbst: Yes.

 [deleted]: absolutely.

 dudleydidwrong: They do seem to be out to get him.

 t-poke: Yes

 Charli3q: Straight down from Ailes. 100%

 SixteenBeatsAOne: It has to be an edict from the higher-ups at Fox News and
 the RNC. So if Trump survives tonight, then he'll really have a
 teflon-skin.

 patdt13: 100% yes

 dirtyfries: For sure.

 They're aiming to pick the winners and losers. Trump is not a winner to
 them.

 socialistbob: and talk about how great Carly Fiorina is. Three fox analysts
 have said awesome she was in the first debate
