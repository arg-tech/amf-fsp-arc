 Emerica:
 Please someone tell me I'm wrong. Take the people who are Bernie supporters,
 some jump to Webb because he's killing it, but Hillary supporters stay, and
 she ends up ahead because of split votes on Bernie and Webb...

 berlinbrown: I think there is a three way tie. Sanders has some good points
 but his delivery is not solid. Clinton has pretty good delivery.

 Alienm00se: You are wrong. Webb is as far right as you can go as a democrat
 and Bernie is as far left as the party allows.

 calantus: Well, it depends on how many, Bernie might drop and endorse Webb
 or vice versa

 MR_TELEVOID: You're wrong. Jim Webb isn't killing it, at least not in any
 way that would impress Bernie supporters.
