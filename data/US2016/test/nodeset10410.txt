Fox News is throwing softballs to everyone but Trump. They're going right for his throat and he's eating them up.

Trump was also given the most speaking time. They gave him a chance to answer, early in the primaries game, to some of the biggest critiques against him. I feel like assuming Fox is trying to eliminate him may be somewhat naive. All the attention he's been receiving has made him shoot up in the Republican polls. He's gunning hard for the white male vote, and it's working fairly well.

They stopped throwing anything to Carson like half an hour in, though.

His answer to when he became a republican was his weakest response.

He's the turd in Roger Ailes punchbowl.

You really see his business side by the way he responds. He does not back down. He is kind of like an FDR. Full of shit, but the people like it at the time.
