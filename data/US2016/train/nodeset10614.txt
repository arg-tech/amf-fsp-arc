Brags427: I think Trump is doing great. He answered how he will create jobs, raising import tax, thus pushing manufacturers to use US plants instead because it is cheaper. He is also a stronger debater than Hilary. Hilary is robotic and letting Trump own the conversation
ohnoaguitarist: We watching the same debate?
Kai_Daigoji: He answered how he will create jobs
No, he didn't.
Brags427: If you raise import tax, making it more expensive to manufacturer out of the states than in the states, what do you think will happen? That's what he said. Plus he's funny
Kai_DaigojiMinnesota: what do you think will happen?
A trade war.
powelle2: Lol.
