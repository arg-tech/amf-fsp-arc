Honestly, when Trump starts talking I can not follow what the hell he is saying. His words don't translate to any coherent idea in my head. He just makes me confused. I can't even disagree with him because I don't know what he's trying to say.

 My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.

 Donald Trump
