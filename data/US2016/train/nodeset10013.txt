xixoxixa: Sanders isn't answering this question.
SixBiscuit:He's not. I have no idea why he wanted to tie himself so much to the democratic socialist label. Clinton has identified herself as a progressive. Sanders has identified himself as a socialist. It's poison for him.
Vankraken: The term socialist has been demonized so heavily in US politics from the Cold War era. The US is hardly a pure capitalist nation and yet the term socialist makes Americans think it's just a step away from everyone waiting in line for bread rations.
SixBiscuit: Exactly. So don't try and get cute about it.
bourne2011: He avoided that question like the plague.
Teh_Slayur: It's empty labeling. That's why he responded with actual explanation rather than a simple "yes" or "no." "Socialism" means very different things depending on context. Sanders makes it clear he's referring to capitalism with progressive policies (like all other advanced nations, or "major countries" as he called them).
Bigtuna546: He isn't answering any question.
He sounds like a broken record every time he speaks. I feel like these debates are going to expose the lack of substance in his campaign.
ryanwhodat: A lot of people in denial here, but that's the honest truth.
SlowMotionSprint: How is there a lack of substance in his campaign?
