BAIER: Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir. 

TRUMP: Our country is in serious trouble. We don't win anymore. 
We don't beat China in trade. We don't beat Japan, with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country, in trade. We can't beat Mexico, at the border or in trade. 
We can't do anything right. Our military has to be strengthened. Our vets have to be taken care of. We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that. 
Thank you. 
BAIER: Gentlemen, thank you. 

KELLY: It's over! 

BAIER: That's it. 

KELLY: Are you relieved? You were nervous before, they -- they don't look relieved. They look "get me outta here." 
Thank you all very much, and that will do it for the first Republican primary debate night of the 2016 presidential race. Our thanks to the candidates, who will now be joined by their families on stage.
