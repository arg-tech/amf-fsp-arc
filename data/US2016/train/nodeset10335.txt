 Rand Paul ain't backing down.

 spacelemon: Fucking love that guy.

 ponyrojo: I forgot how much I like Rand Paul.

 He was the only one that even remotely mentioned civil liberties and trying
 to roll back legislation that continues to infringe on people's freedom. That
 means a lot to me.

 madbadanddangerous: He is the only Rep I'd be OK to see elected. Just
 because I think his main goal would be to totally refactor the NSA/CIA to
 stop infringing on US citizens. Too few people are worried about that and he
 is one of the only Senators who actively works to that goal.
