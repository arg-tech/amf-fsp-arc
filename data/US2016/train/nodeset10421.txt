In terms of gay marriage, great answer Kasich. It's nice to hear a different, refreshing perspective from the Republican side of things.

Very nice to hear.
If he keeps saying it, it will probably cost him the VP slot.

Can you say "swing state"? If you can lock up Florida and Ohio just by having their politicians on your ticket, you've got a pretty damn good start on winning the presidency.

Good point, which is why I said probably. The base will hate it, but I guess they could go that way if they felt certain he could deliver Ohio. I still think it's a major problem for him come time to choose.

Would it though? You want a VP that might swing independents.

Throw in the fact he's the current governor of a huge swing state and he's pretty much the best VP candidate anyone could hope for at this point in time.
Having lived in Ohio for the last 20 years, Kasich has improved a bit from when he was first elected, but I personally still don't fully trust him. Part of me would like to hope, though, that his early attempts at pushing certain legislation and the massive pushback he got caused him to wise up and realize he needs to be far more cooperative.
So yeah, he's gotten better, but I still don't fully trust the guy, however I could absolutely see someone tapping him to be their VP selection primarily because he's more moderate and from Ohio.
