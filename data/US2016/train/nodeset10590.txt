Serious question for the trumpers here: do you actually think trump is doing well? I just have a hard time how you could see him as the "winner" here

Check out their sub....although half the comments are just insulting clintons face.

To be fair, she spent the first ten minutes looking like a robot trying not to explode. She loosened up a lot once Trump started to unravel.

I asked that in the Donald. Got down voted, the post removed lol. I think they think this is going well.

I don't think you could see either as the winner honestly. He's hammered home her negative points, but lost his all of his strong points in his rambling.

She's had a look of, "Shit, move on. PLEASE." multiple times in the debate (specifically during the email and ISIS segments) but hammered him a few times on policy.

It's a 50/50 for me (note, I'm voting for neither).
