Why did she delete the 33,000 emails?

What does that have to do with the question?

Has nothing to do with Don the Con's taxes. Non sequitur

Why wouldn't she delete 33,000 emails? Don't you delete yours?

Cringe.

Who cares! there fucking emails. The president does a lot more than send fucking emails.

Emails that possibly hide criminal activity.

That's a fucking joke and I honestly hope you don't actually believe it.

We already know she lied about not sending or receiving classified information. I'm sure there was a lot of classified info in those 33,000 emails she has deleted.
Hillary is a piece of shit.

WHO CARES! In the grand scheme of things it's irrelevant, and the FBI couldn't find any reason to bring charges. Donald Trump can't mutter a coherent sentence and you're worried about some fucking emails? It's nonsensical.
