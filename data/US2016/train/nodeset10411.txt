It's not even subtle anymore. The RNC and Fox are trying to kill Trump and they're failing so hard. I'm so glad he's getting the nomination. The nation is seeing the true Republican party.

It's so ridiculously visible that Trump will be able to have a great time afterward pointing it out.
Trump thrives on conflict and chaos. Giving him mediocre, softball questions would likely have been the better way to hurt his campaign.

Why would they do, though? What do they have against him?

They're making it worse if anything. Or better. Whichever way that works for you...
