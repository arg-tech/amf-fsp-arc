 : As someone who's supported Bernie prior, I'm really reevaluating that.
 Clinton's views are a lot more nuanced and developed in my opinion.

 You can't attack capitalism as a system, and in the next breath talk about
 how entrepreneurship is what makes America great. Clinton's view that
 sometimes capitalism needs controls in order to deal with inequality were a
 lot more realistic.

 Also who are the rest of these guys on stage? /s

 MostlyPurple : I agree, but I guess the question is whether or not I
 actually believe that Hillary would do any of that.

 tdlop: I think what she said was more or less what Sanders meant, but he's
 doing a really bad job of communicating. As a big supporter: he needs to get
 his shit together very soon or it's over.

 Teh_Slayur: He wasn't attacking free enterprise itself. He said he opposes
 "casino capitalism". The social democracies of Europe, which he
 mentioned, are all capitalist countries, as are all other advanced industrial
 nations, which he is basing his policies on (universal healthcare, family and
 medical leave, progressive taxation, etc).
