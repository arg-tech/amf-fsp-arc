 FFS Trump they're not all Mexicans

 ~Marco Rubio

 cantplaynice: They are to us.

 ~GOP voters

 SweeterThanYoohoo: I actually really liked Rubio's stance about the border.
 Seemed very pragmatic and realistic, almost like he takes it personally. You
 could actually hear some, what seemed like normal, emotion from him when he
 spoke briefly about the people who call his office about immigrating here
 legally.

 I think he said we should build a wall though, and I don't like that idea,
 but for the most part I think he's got it right.

 dbcspace: Rubio isn't your typical republican, I'll give him that. I don't
 see the base choosing him, though. Partly because he might fling open the
 gates and let all the 'Mexicans' in, partly because he's not crass enough to
 compete with the others feeding the base red meat.

 Rubio and Kasich remind me of Huntsman in that they're not batshit insane,
 so they'll get bounced out sooner than later...
