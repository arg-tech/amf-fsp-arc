WALLACE : Governor Huckabee , like Governor Walker , you have staked out strong positions on social issues . You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage . You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions , except for the life of the mother . Millions of people in this country agree with you , but according to the polls , and again this an electability question , according to the polls , more people do n't , so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016 ? 

HUCKABEE : Chris , I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment . That 's a long and difficult process . I 've actually taken the position that 's bolder than that . A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood , as if that 's a huge game changer . I think it 's time to do something even more bold . I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth , and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother 's womb is a person at the moment of conception . The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on . And , this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child 's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law . It 's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being , and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they 're parts to a Buick .
