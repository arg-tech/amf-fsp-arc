 reaper527:
 remember when republicans used to get mocked and laughed at when they said
 that illegal immigrants would be getting obamacare coverage? now you have a
 field of democrat presidential candidates supporting it.

 foreverburning: No. If anything they were mocking them because why would
 you deny healthcare to people regardless of citizenship status?

 17th_knight: They should get the coverage. They are here, they work, they
 are a part of this society. Fuck off with your xenophobia.

 reaper527: They are here

 that's actually the problem. stop encouraging them to be here.

 crack down on companies that employ them, and don't give them benefits if
 they come in illegally.

 by all means, offer them benefits if they are here on a visa and are
 actually making an honest effort to be here legally, but if they can't bother
 to come in the right way, we shouldn't be spending a dime to make their life
 easier. spend that money on a legal resident instead.

 17th_knight:

 that's actually the problem.

 No it isn't. Go fear monger about immigrants to someone else.
