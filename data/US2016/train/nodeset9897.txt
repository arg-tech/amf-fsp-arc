 I don't even want to write this because it's the sort of conspiracy thing
 that normally I'd think deserves to be mocked, but doesn't Hillary seem sort
 of too prepared for some of the questions? The Denmark thing was weird to me
 because it was a comparison that Anderson Cooper brought up, not Sanders, yet
 it was naturally built into Hillary's response. She also goes right into
 points when answering questions with zero of the slow build-up candidates
 normally take to think up their answers. She's slower when answering issues
 the other candidates bring up. I don't know, maybe she is honestly that good
 at debate. I'm probably overthinking things. It just seems slightly off to
 me.

 EDIT: Also is everyone just going to ignore the fact that Cooper straight
 up changed the question "Answer do black lives matter or do all lives
 matter?" to basically "oh what would you do about crime?" When
 talking to Clinton?

 deadletter: Practice debates.

 Speedson: she has done 19 political debates in her time. she has had the
 best people in the game prep her for this debate. she is more prepared for
 this debate than any other candidate.

 I-Have-3-Girlfriends: She's a good debater due to experience and having the
 best advisers in the world (mostly). She's also extremely rehearsed for that
 same reason. A debate gaffe can tank a campaign.

 jutspg1980: As i remember it, Sanders first mentioned Denmark, Norway, and
 Sweden.

 But that must be a common talking point because Anderson was prepared with
 the 5.6 mil population stat as a response
