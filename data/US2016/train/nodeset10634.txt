Alt forums are saying he's crushing her. What? What planet are these people on?

Just look at people in these comments.

The planet where of he open his speech with a stroke, they'd say he won.

Not going to bother paying attention to reddit on who's voting. I'm just gonna let the votes do the talking.

They know that it's going to be 8 years of Clinton, thier facebook is going to get a workout.

I hate them equally. He is doing to her exactly what he did to all the Republican candidates in the debates.. Louder and and more insulting. They just don't know what to do against it. America is fucked either way.

The planet where whoever is loudest and interrupts the other the most wins

Well she's losing face hard. No one is listening to what she says unless they're already voting for her. People on the fence are probably looking for strength, and she's losing it.

Im obviously biased but I think it's because he sounds like he cares more. Clinton is being more technical, but Trump is coming across far more passionately.
She looks like she's starting to get flustered.
