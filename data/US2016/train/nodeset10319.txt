 I hate that I like Trump's realness...

 Rabid-Duck-King: No need to hate yourself, it's kind of refreshing to peel
 off the veneer of spin that most politicians are trying to put out.

 You don't have to agree with what he's saying at all, but I do appreciate
 that he's being blunt about it.

 sddnpoopxplsndss: It is just so damn refreshing!

 Silverfin113: i love it if he can keep it up and go against the democratic
 candidate it will be glorious

 sddnpoopxplsndss: It is weird --- his campaign is such a sideshow but I
 like it because its the most real.

 sddnpoopxplsndss: and he doesn't need anyone else's money. Althought he
 wants it and likes it. Thats what scares me. I like a candidate who doesn't
 need / want to take money from "public interest" groups. But Trump
 just likes money.

 I_Wish_I_Was_Fun: Right?..
