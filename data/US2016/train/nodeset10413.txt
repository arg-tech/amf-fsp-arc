The only way a republican can win amongst their own is to eat their own. They're devouring eachother here and exposing their methods. These guys must hate Trump for showing all the magicians tricks they use.

haha. hillary is laughing. let them kill each other.

Rasalom 
I hope Hillary chokes. Bernie 2016.

DoctorIndyJones 
I don't see how Bernie beats Hillary by not eating her.

Rasalom 
Bernie beats Hillary by being honest. Being himself.

DoctorIndyJones 
For sure, but that also means confronting her on the issues and not letting things go unchallenged with the guise of being "civil."

Rasalom 
In time. He's already trying to get more Democratic debates going. She's the one avoiding him.

DoctorIndyJones 
I consider myself a conservative, but I am a lot more interested in that debate than this one. I know Senator Sanders believes what he says and I hope he shows everybody what Hillary really is.

Rasalom 
I think Hillary will collapse naturally next to Bernie's honesty and insistence on focusing on actual solutions to actual problems. Not by playing partisan politics and smear campaign swipes.
