To Americans: how hard is Hillary winning this debate in your eyes?

It's hard to watch. I feel embarrassed for Trump, being humiliated in front of the entire world. Poor guy.

This stuff is broadcasted all over the world. It's 4:30 in the morning here, but there is no way I'm missing out on this. Bozo the presidential candidate needs his own tv-show... oh wait.

Maybe a twitter account called "Shit my President says"

I hate them both, but as an American, expect President Trump.

As a citizen of earth - how soon can we move to Mars?



DarkMarmot

Pieces of us should land on Mars soon enough :( (just as soon as Trump discovers that irresistable, pulsating red button...)
