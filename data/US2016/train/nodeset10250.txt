 Honestly, What is there to be impressed with about Hillary? She doesn't have
 concrete stands on any issue, doesn't go into details about her ideas, and
 just uses buzzwords and pure rethoric to try and get people to agree

 tripbin: Reminds me of that family guy episode where Lois runs for
 mayor.

 I_Am_A_Mudcrab: I was half tempted to post that link

 ne99ne: There is nothing impressive about her other than her ambition, and
 her pandering.

 ChristianTaz: Isn't that kind of the same as Bernie Sanders?

 As president, Sanders has promised to raise minimum wage to $15.00, make
 sure no one working 40 hours a week is in poverty, put 13 million to work by
 investing a trillion dollars in infrastructure, reverse the NAFTA, CAFTA and
 PNTR trade agreements, create a million jobs by investing 5.5 billion in
 youth jobs, make tuition free at all public colleges, expand social security,
 enact universal healthcare and prekindergarten program, break up big
 finanacial institutions, tax carbon and methane emissions, demilitarize the
 police force, have police forces that reflect the diversity of our
 communities, make election day a holiday, ban for profit prisons, invest in
 drug courts, help people who went to jail rebuild their lives, abolish assest
 forfeiture... and more. That's just some stuff off his official
 website.

 It seems like just about anything anyone would want to get people to
 agree.

 I_Am_A_Mudcrab: one difference is that he has shown he actually cares about
 that shit and not just for votes.

 ChristianTaz: Well being able to care and being able to get stuff done are
 kind of two different things. I think Bernie has made a long list of promises
 he won't be able to deliver on without approval of congress... which he
 probably won't have for a lot of his propositions
