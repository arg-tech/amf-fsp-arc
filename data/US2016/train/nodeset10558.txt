There he is folks, the best and brightest conservative republican in America.

Let's see how he does against the corporate lackey and whore of the Saudi petroleum dictatorship who has hilariously convinced "educated liberals" that she's progressive.

Yeah, we're all seeing how he does lol.

As an actual progressive, I'm no hillary fan, but she took his nuts away and crushed them and it's not even over.

Your sexism seems to indicate you're more of the regressive type, but I digress.

I'm seeing how he does against the Saudi. Not too bad, as his poll numbers indicate.

Nice lecture on sexism, you just called someone a whore not one comment ago.



No_stop_signs

It wasn't a lecture on sexism, it was an observation of fact.

And whore is gender neutral. Come on, it's 2016, you backward regressive. The fact you thought the word must have been referring to being a woman shows how awful you are.

whore [hawr, hohr or, often, hoo r] noun 1. a woman who engages in promiscuous sexual intercourse, usually for money; prostitute; harlot; strumpet.

If it wasn't obvious that is not the definition I was using, then you're sexist or stupid. Probably both.
