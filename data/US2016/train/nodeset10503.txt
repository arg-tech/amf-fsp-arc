Trump looks like he wants to eat Hillary.
EarthExile: That was a chilling thing to hear from the potential President
jans_candles: He's not handling himself well while she's speaking.
subatomicpokeball: He's throwing temper tantrums already and it's only been 15 minutes
sawmyoldgirlfriend: That's where Hillary's seasoned political background comes into play. You don't see her constantly interrupting and being childish despite the fact that what she's saying hasn't really been that impactful so far.
subatomicpokeball: Exactly, shes playing very calculatedly and letting him shit all over the place and then cleaning up, and she's doing it well.
MGLLNMaryland: [Internal Screaming]
subatomicpokeball: I'm externally screaming
Pedophilecabinet: Both my mind and body are screaming and I can't think. My fingers are just typing this fervent rage state without any consciousness.
cartsyfartsy: Or when he's speaking, frankly.
AnotherPint: She could have called him out on that and won this thing then and there.
BurtonCommaLeVar: What do you call making shit tons of money off the misfortune of working class people? It's called business!
/rimshot
tacknosaddle: I thought she missed a chance to hit him there with something along those lines.
LazerSquid: Why? He wasn't acting in a presidential capacity when he said those things, you can't think he'd have the same interests if elected
EarthExile: Why can't I assume a narcissistic 70 year old billionaire will continue to believe and act as he always has? Seems like a safe enough bet
LittleBitGenghisKhan:Yeah, it doesn't reflect well on the average American who doesn't own a business.
IsthatTacoPie: What? No it's not. He's in real estate, that's how you make money in real estate. Buy low sell high
droidloot: And don't honor your contracts, apparently.
kaztrator: I think it was worse when he said "that's called being smart" in reference to not paying federal income taxes.
DogPawsCanType: Its true though, as a business owner you do what you can to minimize tax.
lud1120: And that is cheating, making the companies wealthier and more successful than they have the right to be.
DogPawsCanType: No, you are simply doing all you can within the guidelines set by the government to make your business as profitable as it can be. Only an idiot pays more tax than they have too.
the_royal_sequence: I mean.. we should design a tax code that expects businesses and people to avoid it as much as possible.. because that's what people and businesses do (and should do IMO, why pay out money you don't have to).
There is a big difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Smart rich people just use tax avoidance.
Edit: If you want to fix the problem, close the loopholes. But to do that you have to get out the politicians that allow them to be there. It is a politicians job to serve the people, it is a business owner's job to serve the business.
xenoSpiegel: you need a brain to understand the difference between tax evasion and tax optimization
PazDak: About the worst time to say that Business trumps society.
SlectionSocialSanity: As soon as he said that she was reciting the line about the millions of people that lost their homes. Perfect timing, it's called business.
congerbot: Mafia slogan forevs
