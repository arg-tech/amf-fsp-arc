 Use the deaths of people in 9/11 to help your campaign, classy. Fuck off
 Chris Christie.

 mydarkmeatrises: I've hugged victims, dammit!

 ELECT ME!!!

 Sang_dirty_old_town: Yeah and half of those views are you in your mom's
 basement with the x-files on the in background. The other half is the rest of
 the tin-hat brigade.

 DishonestCartooNIST: You can't even watch the most popular video on C-SPAN
 because you're a 9/11 Faither? That's pathetic.

 phrizand: To be fair, he specifically said that hugging the families of
 9/11 victims had nothing to do with politics, seems legit to me. /s

 CamNewtonsLaw: FFS, I don't think you were paying attention. He made it
 very clear. He said when he hugged families after 9/11 it wasn't political.
