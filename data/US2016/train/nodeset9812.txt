 debates"

 - /r/politics

 anyhistoricalfigure: Yeah. Imo he's losing this one right now.

 Zeno84: Can we search for this line on reddit, and call out all the users
 who said this?

 Because I saw it A LOT.

 Bigtuna546: Top kek

 holyfruits: Hillary wiping the floor with everyone right now.jikls: Sure as
 fuck isn't happening yet.

 sweetmatter: PREACH. This was consistently maintained by /r/reddit yet it
 did not happen. Bernie Sanders absolved Hillary of these made-up boogeywoman
 scandals reddit has been obsessed with. Hillary was logical, concise, and
 summative and unfortunately, Bernie Samders had trouble answering a lot of
 questions directly and kept relying on soundbytes about income inequality
 which he had difficulty reciting tonight.
