KELLY : For the record , it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell . 

TRUMP : Yes , I 'm sure it was . 

KELLY : Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women 's looks . You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees . Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president , and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton , who was likely to be the Democratic nominee , that you are part of the war on women ? 

TRUMP : I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct . [ applause ] I 've been challenged by so many people , and I do n't frankly have time for total political correctness . And to be honest with you , this country does n't have time either . This country is in big trouble . We do n't win anymore . We lose to China . We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border . We lose to everybody . And frankly , what I say , and oftentimes it 's fun , it 's kidding . We have a good time . What I say is what I say . And honestly Megyn , if you do n't like it , I 'm sorry . I 've been very nice to you , although I could probably maybe not be , based on the way you have treated me . But I would n't do that . [ applause ] But you know what , we -- we need strength , we need energy , we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around . That , I can tell you right now .
