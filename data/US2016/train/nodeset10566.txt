Here it is: Hillary doesn't need/won't get trump supporters. This is basically a debate to get people to realize how fucking crazy Donald Trump is and get them to vote for Hillary out of sheer terror of a Trump presidency.

That really is Hillary's strategy here. As someone else in this thread earlier told me, she's trying to be the adult in the room. It's not a great strategy, but it may be just enough....

No matter how this debate went they weren't changing. Either he kills it or the MSM attacks him. In the eyes of his supporters he's either the victim or the ultimate conqueror, no in between there.
