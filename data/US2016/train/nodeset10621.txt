I would have loved to see a Barack Obama/Donald Trump debate.

Weaglebeagle: It would have been a bloodbath. Obama would trounce this clown.

Dear lord it'd be a high school team playing an NFL team. Obama would run the table.

TrueDru1
Obama would've swept the building with Trump.

TheTruth4k 
Trump would get steam-rolled

Dead lord murder is illegal man.

SirTreeTreeington 
Obama would deal a fatal blow then bring him back to life just so he can kill him again. Give his signature smile and chuckle before walking off.

He'd drop the mic on Trump's still beating heart, just so we could hear it's tempo slow down until there was only silence.

He's failing enough against Clinton, that would be murder.

MightyGamera 
He could have just lifted up his certificate and shout some variation of "Tax returns! Now!" every time Trump opened his mouth.
But then people would cry about Trump being bullied.

For most entertaining I would go with Joe Biden.

Johner1261 
Or even better, Biden.

betaruga 
Fuuuck. That would have been legendary

Bernie Sanders vs Trump debate.
