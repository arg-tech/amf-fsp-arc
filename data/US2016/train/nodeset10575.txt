wasn't nato originally an anti-soviet union idea during the cold war? is it obsolete now? who knows.

it was a defensive allaince agains the Soviet Union.

in present day, it's a defensive alliance. it takes a lot to get it involved in actual War. to get it involved against terriosim would take a lot of effort, and go against why it was created.
