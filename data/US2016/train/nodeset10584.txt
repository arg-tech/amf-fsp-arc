As a neutral, can i just say I despise hillary. She is such a typical politician. Talks down, avoids issues by pumping lies... jesus.

On the other hand, Trump is just... lol.

Good luck america!

Typical politician is better than Trump. Unfortunately.



Jewsus_allah 

Probably have to agree. Given the email scandal among other things... do you think if the republicans had a more stable candidate they could have done better? Someone like mcCain



Mrguymanp 

Possibly? As a non republican I don't know.

In a case of Hillary vs McCain, I probably wouldn't give much of shit as they are pretty similar.

Yeah I don't know that much about U.S politics, haven't studied it for a while. It seemed that trump was carrying a lot of momentum earlier this year due to his own... charisma? (lol). But now he seems to be dragging them down.
