 A No Fly Zone in Syria isn't really that dangerous, Bernie...

 siouxsie_siouxv2: If it means we are firing at russian planes

 TeamRainbow6: Until we shoot down a mig and ww3 happens.....

 foodVSfood: The way I understand a "no fly zone" is that its not
 dangerous at all if we don't enforce it. If we actually enforce it, then it
 means shooting down things that fly in the "no fly zone." So
 shooting down a Russian jet seems like it could be an escalation.

 bashar_al_assad: It doesn't look
 good for Russia to fight back and escalate against a no fly zone though. They
 would have to come outright and say that they're supporting Assad, otherwise
 they have no reason to be against the no fly zone.

 foodVSfood: True. I'm not a foreign policy expert but I just think that US
 shooting down a Russian Jet over a country that is not the US would be a big
 gamble. It could easily turn ugly.

 bashar_al_assad: It's a gamble, but there's no advantage for Russia to
 escalate it.

 They'll sling shit against the US in the international sphere, but most
 countries are going to side with NATO against Russia.

 [deleted]It is when the Russians decide to just ignore it.
