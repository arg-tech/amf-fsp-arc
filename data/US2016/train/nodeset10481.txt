LawsGuy: It's funny to me how nobody seems to be able to prove it either way. Both sides just cling onto their studies and point to them exasperatedly. Which truth do you believe? Xatencio00: No serious economist would argue that women get paid less for working the same job, with the same experience, and the same number of hours. LawsGuy: You do realize you're just saying that right? You have no citation, no evidence you're presenting at all. If I asked someone who believed the opposite, they'd say the opposite. So good job! Xatencio00: How about this? https://www.google.com/search?q=gender%20pay%20gap%20myth&amp;rct=j LawsGuy: Thank you, that's better. I mean I doubt it tells the entire story because there still isn't good maternity leave in America yet. However this is at least some information.
