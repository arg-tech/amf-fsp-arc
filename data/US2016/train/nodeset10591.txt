B-52: Introduced in 1952.

Tu-95: Introduced in 1952.

The Russian's strategic bomber is as old as ours. I fail to see what relevance this has to anything.

Thank you for this tidbit.

TIL that the Russian's have a propeller bomber named the TU-95 that came out the same year as the B-52.

NEAT!

TU-95 was being manufactured until 1994.

Airframes have a limited lifespan. Avionics need to be updated.

The B-52H airframe has a ~35,000 flight hour service life. We keep sufficient aircraft in reserve to support B-52H operations past 2040, by which point the B-21 will be operational.

B-52H avionics sustainment is ongoing, including $110M in 2000 and $750M in 2009.

Basically, the aircraft will be mission-ready for at least another 24 years -- long enough that its replacement will be ready.
