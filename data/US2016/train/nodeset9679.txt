17th_knight: Webb does have a semi-decent point about affirmative action. There is a uniquely horrifying experience with uniquely horrifying history that has effects to this day on the African American population. But let's not pretend that Latin-American immigrants aren't often at a severely disadvantaged position as well. Janube: It's an argument that has a good point that I don't
 think Webb made.

 Affirmative action is an evil; it is, at its heart, a kind of
 discrimination/bias. )However, what a lot of (usually white, middle class)
 people don't realize is that it's a necessary evil that is in specific
 recompense for the conditions that we deliberately created for black people
 in our country.

 The conditions for latinos in this country is half-intentional and
 half-incidental to how the US developed in relation to Mexico. There wasn't a
 deliberately artificial hole that latinos were put in by American systems (at
 least to the same extent). Moreover, the solutions to the problems and the exact
 kinds of problems faced by the two (broad/vague) ethnicities are, to a fair
 extent, different in nature and origin. The solution of education is the
 better solution for the demographic that already largely resides in the US
 (black persons), while a more immediate solution for latinos would be
 immigration reform.

 Those are a few reasons why Webb's point missed the mark. This comic (http://www.thbook.org/lightofthemoon/pics/Brief%20history%20of%20race%20relations%20in%20the%20US.jpg) is
 pretty spot in for being a short, visual description of a very long,
 complicated problem.
