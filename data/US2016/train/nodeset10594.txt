This man keeps interrupting himself. He's his own worse heckler.

And what's with all the side-tangents?

That's literally how he talks.

I want a president who can at least speak coherently. Like fuck all the other qualifications and controversy. At least SHE can finish a sentence.

Yes.... I can't even follow him because of his side tangents.



CocoH2Ofiend 

When following all of everything he says I cannot even remember what Lester's question was by the time he finishes.

All he keeps doing is looping around to Iran, money being owed to us by NATO and protectorates, and Hilary making ISIS.

And something about Japan.
