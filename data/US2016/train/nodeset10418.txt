Why can't these motherfuckers actually act like politicians instead of warmongering morons.
Tearing apart the Iran deal and reinstittuing sanctions is ass backwards.
Why do that?

Because they won't have to deal with the consequences of their positions until and unless they're elected, and in the mean time, reactionary chest-beating bolsters their visibility?

I know. It's just frustrating.
I'd rather see a rational, nuanced position.

Yup! I don't think short-form media is really the place for that... And adversarial short-form is even harder to balance out between making salient points and being able to come to grips with complex issues.

Because they wouldn't, but it gets the people going.
