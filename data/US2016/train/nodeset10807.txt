COOPER: Thirty seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee, what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? 
CHAFEE: It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East. There's no doubt about it. 
COOPER: OK. 
CHAFEE: And it all started with the Iraq invasion. 
COOPER: Governor O'Malley? 
O'MALLEY: I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL; climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible). 
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, the greatest national security threat? 
CLINTON: I â€” I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands. I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that's why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that. 
COOPER: Senator Sanders, greatest national security threat? 
SANDERS: The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis. 
COOPER: Senator Webb? 
WEBB: Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.
