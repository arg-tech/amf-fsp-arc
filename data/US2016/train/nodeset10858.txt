COOPER: Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You've emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign. Aren't these two things in conflict? 

CHAFEE: No, that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act, and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant. And I voted for that. 

COOPER: Do you regret that vote? 

CHAFEE: No, no. As long as you're getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance, but you need a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says. And in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far. So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act. 

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act? 

CLINTON: No, I don't. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in. 
We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security. It's not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind. 

COOPER: Senator â€” Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001... [applause] 
SANDERS: It was 99 to one and I was maybe the one. I don't know.
