 I'm still confused from earlier...how does anderson cooper know the exact
 population of Denmark off the top of his head?

 Shadowr54: Education is weird like that.

 JRockPSU: He was most likely expecting Sanders to specifically bring up
 Denmark when asked about universal healthcare and wanted to ZIP ZING POW him
 right back with some numbers.

 Ajwf: Bernie talks about Denmark often. It's probably a sparknote that he
 had just because CNN figured it'd show up.

 mud074: I would imagine he has some way, likely an earpiece, to talk to
 some people specially for situations like that.

 shadowofahelicopter: Earpiece: he's got a room full of people telling him
 what to say.

 TerraBlack: Hes superhuman

 queen_ravioli: He probably knew Sanders would cite Denmark as an example of
 democratic socialism and was prepared with the figure.
