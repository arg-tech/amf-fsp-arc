This is terrible...didn't Trump like practice? Didn't Hillary realize coming off as a snarky teenager isn't a good look either?

I disagree about Hillary, she knows he's making a fool of himself and is just playing off it

Against any other opponent it wouldn't work, but here it just makes it look like Donald completely unfazed her, while he constantly rises to her bait.

Also shows she has a sense of humor and some good timing in there too

Trump didn't practice. His campaign staff has been touting that to lower expectations, but most thought they might had been underplaying his prep. It doesn't appear they were lying.

It's pretty hard to take Trump seriously.

God i love this country. God forbid we actually get two mature adults to run for president. Better get a liar and a tv star to run, that's a great idea!

It is hard not to come up like that. He sounds like a lunatic

Trump is useless but Hillary's "laugh" makes me want to stop watching, how on earth do people think it's a sign of her dominance

Clinton has largely been fine. She has generally sat back and let Trump implode.

Hillary is clearly the more informed, and prepared of the two, but she struggles at debates. Tonight she is doing pretty decent, but I think snarky comments are a strategy to get laughs and quick thoughts to distract.

1) have you not watched donald the past 8 months??

2) guess we know where her supporters get the snarkyness from..
