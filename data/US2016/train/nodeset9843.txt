 ELI5: Syria is a quagmire in a quagmire.

 BenDes1313: It is a disaster of a country in a disaster of a region and we
 should spare ourselves the trouble of getting sucked in and wasting time and
 resources on something we cannot fix.

 mjj1492: Iraq within Iraq

 Talcove: Giggidy.

 indie90: Originally the conflict in Syria was the Assad regime verse rebels
 looking to overthrow him. This was original quagmire. Add in ISIS verse and
 you basically create a three way fight between assad forces the rebels and
 isis and then you also get other states invovled and you have your quagmire
 within a quagmire.
