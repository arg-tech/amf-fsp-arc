COOPER: You're over your time as of now. 

WEBB: I will â€” well, you've let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this... 

COOPER: You agreed to these debate rules. 

WEBB: ... to the unelected, authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that. 

COOPER: Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond. 

SANDERS: Pardon me? 

COOPER: I'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this. 

SANDERS: Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that... 

COOPER: He doesn't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot. 

SANDERS: Well, I think he's already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy. And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face. But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now.
