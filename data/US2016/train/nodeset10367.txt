Chris Christie freaking hugged Obama after a horrible natural disaster ravaged his home state you fucking tool.
I thought Reddit said that Rand Paul was supposed to be the rational one here.
prophetofgreed: He's a scumbag like all the others on the stage.
Mr_Titicaca: You'll come to realize that the GOP really is a fucking mess overall. There's no rational thinking there man.
otter_pop_n_lock: But notice how Christie didn't acknowledge that he hugged Obama. Instead he just talked about the families of Sandy.
stumblinhigh: *9/11
Acheron13: It wasn't just a hug. It was a photo op for Obama during the 2012 campaign. At the same time Christie was refusing to meet with Romney.
