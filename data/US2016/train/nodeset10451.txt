WALLACE : Senator Cruz , your colleague , Senator Paul , right there next to you , said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues , but he says you do nothing to grow the party . He says you feed red meat to the base , but you do n't reach out to minorities . You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress . You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently . [ applause ] How can you win in 2016 when you 're such a divisive figure ? 

CRUZ : Chris , I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth . [ applause ] If you 're looking for someone to go to Washington , to go along to get along , to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests , then I ai n't your guy . There is a reason that we have $ 18 trillion in debt . Because as conservatives , as Republicans , we keep winning elections . We got a Republican House , we 've got a Republican Senate , and we do n't have leaders who honor their commitments . I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do . [ applause ]
