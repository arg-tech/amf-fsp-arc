You saw number 1 for the first 10 minutes or so. Tactful, polite, and reasonable, relatively speaking.
Then number 2 came out, yelling, interrupting, saying crazy shit.
This is frightening. He's going from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde right in front of us.

Number 2 is his real personality. He managed to fake it for about 10 minutes and couldn't keep it up.

I want to respect Trump 1. I fear Trump 2.
