 Rocag:
 "They call me Jeb. Because I earned it." What?

 uninan: He's saying he's not riding on his families success.

 Rocag: He chose a strange way of wording it.

 Grace_Wincer: I understood it just fine.

 Dr_Lobster: Sounds like you don't understand how rhetoric works...

 dtpistons04: Which is hilarious because the b in jeb stands for bush

 SnakeNoir: And Je means "me" or "I" in french.

 2dumb2knowbetter: and "bush" stands for failed presidency in
 america

 helo323: he's "not" a Bush

 Nixplosion: Hes trying to say he earned familiarity with his
 'stituents.

 kitchenmaniac111: More like pleb

 invader_red: First name basis you clown lol.

 grungebot5000: well, initials-basis

 IAMHOLLYWOOD_23: Exactly... Um ,, that's your name!?

 jazir5: Must be some weird nickname, like Gob Bluth in Arrested
 development

 helloboots: Gob stands for George-Oscar Bluth, no?

 ThE_CoMpOsR: Makes sense, since Jeb is actually his initials John Ellis
 Bush

 JGT3000: Pretty sure that's where the inspiration for Gob's name came
 from

 sthlmsoul: 

 That's exactly what it is. GOB stands for George Oscar Bluth and Jeb is for
 John Ellis Bush.

 fredfredburger0123: I think he's referring to the fact that no one is
 giving him credit just for being a bush. They don't call him governor bush,
 implying he's just another spoiled bush politician, they call him Jeb because
 he's his own man.

 Webonics: Not Jeb Bush.

 JUST JEB ROUND THESE PARTS!

 MacduffFifesNo1Thane: They call you John Ellis Bush Bush?

 TheRedditDweller: The question was about what separates him from his
 brother. What he was trying to articulate (not so eloquently) is that in
 Florida, he's earned the right to not be lumped in the same category as his
 brother.

 [deleted]: He flubbed the delivery of "They call me Veto Corleone.
 Because I earned it."

 rhomphaia: Lol, was confused at first, too. Pretty sure he was saying he
 earned recognition in FL as Jeb, not as Bush.
