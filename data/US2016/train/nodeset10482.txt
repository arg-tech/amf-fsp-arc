mhaydar: Well they're not, it's not like they're lying
Cyfa: What do you mean though
mhaydar: Women are paid less than men, I don't see why she shouldn't be allowed to bring that up.
Cyfa: They are, but that statistic as a whole ignores the context of the jobs that women and men both trend towards.
strixvarius: They are (for the same work). That stat has been thoroughly debunked.
