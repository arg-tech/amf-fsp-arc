Not sure what Clinton thinks she's going to gain by harping on how racist Trump is.. It's not like he was going to have a huge amount of support from the black community anyway.

Reminding all the white people he's been trying to win.



Bornsalty

He's actually gaining some support...

Isnt that mostly a slight on white Americans for not being put off by his racism?

He doesn't have much to lose from the black community, but he can still lose a lot of support from whites with a conscious.

Enders Wiggins way. You stomp their face in until they are destroyed.



FaithIsFoolish

Black people are the only ones that care about racism

Fair point, I suppose there are at least a handful of 'murica lovin' Trump supporters that are turned off by it.

It's about convincing undecided voters he is racist and therefor shouldn't be president. Same reason trump has given speeches about helping minorities. Not cuz he he thinks he will get their vote, but to convince undecideds that he isn't racist.

Trump is picking up a bit of support with them. Not much, but more than she probably expected.
