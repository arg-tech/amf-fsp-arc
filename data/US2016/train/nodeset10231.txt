 O'Malley knows the correct term: ISIL. With an L

 reaper527: "correct" is all relevant. the 'L' is shitting all
 over israel by declaring their land part of the islamic state.

 if by "correct" you mean giving isis exactly what they want, then
 sure.

 Chekkmate: It's not that I want to shit on Israel or give ISIL what they
 want. It's that the region they occupy is not merely Syria, but part of the
 Levant. It's more of a semantic issue.

 reaper527: It's not that I want to shit on Israel or give ISIL what they
 want.

 that's what you're doing though. "the levant" includes israel. if
 you want to come up with a better name than isis that more accurately
 represents the territory they cover, great. that doesn't mean that ISIL is a
 good name.

 Chekkmate: Yes, the Levant includes Israel, as well as Syria, Lebanon,
 Iraq, Jordan, part of Egypt, etc. but they obviously don't occupy ALL of it,
 as they don't occupy ALL of Syria. So if you want to make it the countries in
 which they have territory, then it should be ISISI or ISIIS (Islamic State of
 Syria and Iraq, or Iraq and Syria), a bit of a superfluous my long and maybe
 hard to pronounce title.
