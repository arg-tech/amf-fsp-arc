Huckabee actually seems very reasonable

He's said some crazy things tonight, but you can't deny that was an amazing soundbyte in favor of his fair tax proposal.

Until you remember he defended a child molester.

It just felt like the huckabee show when he talked. He all but got out the bass guitar and invited Ted nugent on stage haha

I'm not a huge fan but I like him because he's consistent. I can respect consistent even if I find it bat shit crazy at times.
