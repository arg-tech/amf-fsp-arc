SinisterPaige: Webb is not being given the same time as Clinton or Sanders.
bjhoops333: Welcome to politics
Rohkii: Not too different from how the Republican debates went, which was all Trump, Bush, and Fiorina
69username69: Does he deserve it after suggesting that we go to war with China over cyber crimes?
bringmethesampo: I am an Sanders supporter and I think that this is horseshit that Webb and the others aren't given the same time.
SinisterPaige: I have a lot of respect for Sanders, but he's too far to the left.
Sorry, hate me all you want.
bringmethesampo: I am cool with whomever you want to support. I just want to see some equal time rather than this format.
SinisterPaige: I agree.
DabbinDuck: I expect a Webb debate-time graph in the morning. 10 min scale of course.
FreshHotTakes: He's really not. He's also wasting the time he is given.
Soylent_Orange: So?
SinisterPaige: There are other candidates besides Clinton and Sanders.
Soylent_Orange: True but he agreed to the format of the debate as they all did.
SinisterPaige: The major media outlets should not be the ones dictating who wins the primaries.
Soylent_Orange: I agree. I was just saying all these campaigns agreed to the format. Not sure what the solution is especially when only two parties have a stranglehold on our politics and government.
