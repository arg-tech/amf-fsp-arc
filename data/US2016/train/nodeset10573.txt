Can anyone explain why Trump's idea to "take the oil" from Iraq would have been anything other than plunder, which is a war crime?



SasquatchUFO 

Nope.

Trump does not care about your puny accords and conventions, all shall bow to trump

Because stealing "all the Oil" and putting it "somewhere else" is more of a Carmen Sandiego type crime.

He also wants to return to torture, also a war crime.



PhoenixFox 

It would absolutely have been a war crimes and I can't believe she isn't pressing that fact home.

I mean, he also mentioned bringing back waterboarding and "worse than waterboarding" in a primary debate at some point, so I don't think he cares too much about war crimes.



RoccoStiglitz 

Not in a way that would make any kind of sense. Stealing natural resources is indeed a war crime.



vthings 

People kinda gloss over that. I'm surprised that level of blatant 19-century style imperialism isn't getting more scrutiny.



kgraham227 

There's no way to explain it. What he's proposing is LITERALLY stealing the oil.



The_GMD 

It's like a catch-22. If you don't take the oil, a terror division (ISIS) can take control of it in the absence of a solid government in order to fund their operations. If you take the oil, you fuck over the country's economy. It basically comes down to is it less harmful to facilitate a terror group, or is it less harmful to damage a countries economy by taking it's largest import.

WRONG. (that's how this works, right? I just yell wrong over whatever facts you state?)
