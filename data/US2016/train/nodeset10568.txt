Is cybersecurity really a big enough topic to merit its own segment, on par with race relations and trade/economy?

Yes. It's been a pretty big topic lately, and honestly, it'll be one of the biggest challenges over this century.

 

tbst 

Yes. The question could have been about interfering in our elections.

Considering all the data the CIA has on its citizens? Yeah.

Yes. Look at attacks in real time. https://cybermap.kaspersky.com/

Yes.

Think about all the stuff that's online, bank account access, personal information, news, communication, etc. Cyber control is economic control, is information control, is political control. So yes, IMO it is a big enough topic.
