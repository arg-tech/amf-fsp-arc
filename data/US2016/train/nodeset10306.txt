mdp5150:
 I don't know why the critics complain about the lack of diversity in the
 Republican Party, see plenty of diversity on the stage. I see two Hispanics,
 one African-American, several with special needs, one hobbit, one fat ass,
 and a douchebag.

 gingerjojo: Be real, how long have you been planning that one for? Cause
 it's fucking BRILLIANT.

 qjkxkcd:One douchebag?

 [deleted]: The first question was literally "Gentlemen, everybody
 knows you're all douchebags. What is your rebuttal?"

 tthorwoaways: The Fellowship of the RNC.

 Rac3318: Kind of reminds me of my high school.

 theluckyboner: LOL. That was great to read.

 dirtmcgirt412: Is Donald Trump the special needs person, the hobbit and the
 douchebag all in one?

 Hanchan: Don't forget the Canadian.

 imoses44: Shhh... we don't talk about them.

 Caponer95: Like this comment was funny until you took it too far.

 LaVidaYokel: I needed a chuckle. Thanks.

 yupitsani: and unfoetunately, in the midst of all that...NO WOMEN

 fittitthroway: So? Its not like they're lining up to be candidates.

 gaviidae:Simply because Carly didn't make it into the top 10 not because
 the GOP doesn't have female candidates. Palin, Dole, and Bachman show that
 Republicans have female candidates.

 bros_pm_me_ur_asspix:*two fatasses, Huckabee gained back all his weight
 probably due to all the stress from having to defend god-fearing pedophiles
 from the evil Holocaustin' liberals

 MrMountainFace: To be honest, I stopped being able to identify which is
 which after African American

 fatfrost: Teddy Canada is . . . Canadian

 apul_madeekaud: In Chris Christie's defense, he has slimmed down a lot. I
 would say that he has slimmed down to the point of it no longer being a good
 talking point. Look up what he used to look like.
