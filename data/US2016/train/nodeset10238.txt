 right though. O'Malley and Clinton just keep talking, but Cooper keeps saying
 "you agreed to the rules" to him.

 raika11182: To some extent it's up to him to muscle his way in like the
 others. It's a weird part of the game. Doesn't make him wrong, but crying
 "foul" in a debate is bad form and shows weakness.

 MisplacedUsername: It just rubbed me wrong. Before I got more exposure to
 Sanders, I was a Webb supporter, because I think his record would preclude
 the Republicans in Congress from their usual shit, and therefore would be
 able to work more bi-partisan. The Republicans would obstruct Clinton's
 policies even more than Obama, if you thought that was possible. They've
 always hated her, and have been talking shit for years to prepare for this
 election cycle.

 raika11182: Definitely agree there. Whether she is qualified or not, I
 don't believe she can win the general election because the Republican party
 has so thoroughly prepped for it.

 MisplacedUsername: I think she could win, it just depends on voter turnout.
 She's not very energizing. Due to demographics, high turnout means Democratic
 victories in state-wide and federal elections. IIRC, even in the Bush era,
 more voters were registered as Democrats or indicated left leaning than as
 Republican or conservative. The gap is growing due to each younger generation
 becoming statistically more progressive. Liberals just tend to have lower
 turnout. She could win, I just don't think she would accomplish anything due
 to obstruction.
