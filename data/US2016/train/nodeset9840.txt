 : So many people are so desperate for bernie to fail.

 Anyone who thinks Hilary is a better candidate is an idiot.

 We get it, you dont like him because he is popular on reddit...

 TheInfinityBlaze: Hilary is doing well though.

 Velshtein: We don't like him because he's a shitty candidate who can't
 substantiate any of the bullshit he spouts.

 The fact that all you morons lap it up only compounds on it.

 liamliam1234liam: He substantiates everything?

 evnalmightyyy: He is the only one who will speak truthfully yet everyone
 says he doesn't speak eloquently. Political double talk sounds nice but is
 nothing but BS, yet someone who gives no BS gets told they better start
 sounding like a politician.
