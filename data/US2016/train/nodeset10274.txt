 Well, I'd be a female president...

 Cooper: sigh Any policy differences??

 Hillary: well for one thing....

 Cooper: oops sorry we're out of time

 Does it seem that the time allotment for responses is too short?

 Cynical-C: It was a 2.5 hour debate. They have to give short times to get
 through all the topics and allow all candidates to weigh in. It also reduces
 the amount of rambling and fluff.

 -JustShy- :How is this response any different than any of the other
 candidates saying, "Well, I'm not half-black."

 thesmartestdonkey: Read your comment about three times going
 "wtf" until I realized that you weren't actually saying the
 candidates said that... Shit I need sleep.

 VampireKillBot: "Being female is my policy."
