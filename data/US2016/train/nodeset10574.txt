Gary Johnson pledged to cut the military budget by 43 percent in his first term as president. He has stated he supports "slashing government spending", including Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security". And he thinks marijuana can cure ebola. So basically a bunch of libertarian bullshit that will be horrible for the country in the long term.
