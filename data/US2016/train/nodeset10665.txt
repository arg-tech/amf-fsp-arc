Cheering for Hillary is fine, but admonishment for cheering for Trump. So neutral.

It's astonishment for making noise. That wasn't biased. Don't be sensitive.

*admonishment
It's a great rule, but it wasn't applied equally. There was no admonishment when Hillary got cheers/laughs earlier.

MrSilkyJohnson 
Now, to your credit, she just got a pop and Lester hasn't admonished the crowd yet.

Only been one cheer and that was from trump supporters. Don't know what your watching

She dissed him earlier during the first part and got cheers and laughs. There was no comment about it.
