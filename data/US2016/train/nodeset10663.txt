NOTHING LIKE A ROUTINE 15 YEAR STRAIGHT AUDIT

NotQuiteOnTopic 
I have the best audits. No one gets audited as biggly as me!

As soon as is over, though, he'll definitely release his records.

Yeah, I may be preaching to the choir on this sub but the audit excuse seems like utter bullshit. He has the IRS' blessing, so why not release them if everything is Kosher? No sense in hiding behind his lawyers' orders, or deleted emails (another issue altogether).

It's total bullshit. He has no intention of releasing his tax returns.

"I'll release my returns when the audit is complete."
2 min. later...
"I've been under audit for 15 years!"
Soooo... considering you are being eternally audited, you won't be releasing tax returns? Typical. No use hiding behind the whole audit gig anymore.

Are you suggesting that his tax statements have raised so many red flags that the IRS is compelled to audit him in perpetuity?
Edit: Because that's probably accurate.

That shouldn't worry people so much. A person's likelihood of being audited goes up significantly as they have more money and are involved in more business ventures and investments.
Whatever people think about him, Trump is the head of a complex business empire. It's not all that surprising that he's regularly audited.
