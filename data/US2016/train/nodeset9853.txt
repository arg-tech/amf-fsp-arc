 Hilary is slaying in this debate. Sanders took a step back tonight for
 me.

 fish1oop: I agree that Hilary is doing well and Sanders is
 struggling.

 farfromjordan: Its not even done yet.

 [deleted]: I'm a big Bernie fan and I have even gone to one of his rallies,
 however, I feel as if he's got a LOT of work to do before the next debate.
 This is definitely making me look at Hillary.
creuter: She feels so insincere.
