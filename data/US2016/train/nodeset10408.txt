Can tell me one redeeming thing about Trump? I don't mean to be rude to anyone who supports him, I just feel like I only hear and see negative things about him.

If you have a country $18,000,000,000,000 in debt, you'd want the best businessman possible to run the country in that situation.

Is he the best businessman possible?

Probably not. He's the biggest name in business and an icon though.

He's honest. He is saying exactly what he thinks.

slagnanz 
I guess that is true. Still, I want to know who agrees with him on what and why.
