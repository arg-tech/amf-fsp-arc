mezcao: To be fair, Clinton's name has come up a lot
PM_ME_INSIDER_INFO: And since I last commented, /u/progress18 posted ANOTHER link to The Democrats twitter.
Notice that they're also the mod of /r/HillaryClinton and a full-time poster on /r/Democrat.
I think it's horrible how biased the coverage is. Regardless of your political leaning, you should always be for unbiased coverage.
mezcao: How many times has Clinton's name been brought up since then? I mean, she has had more air time then over half the candidates have.
PM_ME_INSIDER_INFO: That has nothing to do with /u/progress18 posting another The Democrats twitter post..
