We have interests in those countries that we're protecting, moron

And their signed an agreement to pay 2% of their GDP into NATO. Only 5 NATO members out of 28 pay that much.

Are you arguing that America has more self-interest in defending those countries than the people actually living there?

 

livingunique 

No, I'm arguing that we have interests there and the ability to protect them, including Americans who live and do business there. Why wouldn't we do what's required to keep them safe and successful?

Why shouldn't those countries pay us the amount agreed upon? Why should we spend literally billions of dollars to defend them when they've agreed to pay or at least help pay for their own defense?

Why do you believe that countries should be able to renege on treaties with the USA?

You're going to have to give me some specifics of what you mean before I can answer. There's a lot of variables in your questions.

Do you or do you not believe that countries should uphold treaties and agreements that they have with the United States? Because from my position you don't believe that, you believe that the United States should still honor treaties that have been broken by the other party.

Of course I do. I also live in the real world where things happen sometimes that prevent them from being able to. At that point, you have to weigh pros and cons.

Again, if you have a specific instance you're talking about, tell me what it is and then I'll tell you whether or not I think it was the right or wrong decision.

How about NATO nations not paying the 2% of their GDP as they agreed upon for NATO membership. Why do you believe the USA should be part of a one sided relationship?

 

livingunique 

Do the benefits we receive from being part of NATO and from having NATO as a stabilizing force in the world outweigh the 2%? I believe they do.

It's obvious that we disagree on this and we're not going to convince each other.

So you believe that countries don't have to argue with us in good faith and that they can break treaties if we get some undefinable, measurable benefit?

It's an incredibly simple question to answer and I'll repeat it once more. Do you believe that countries should follow through with the agreements and treaties they've signed with the US?
