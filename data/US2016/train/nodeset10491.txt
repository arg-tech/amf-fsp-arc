lKauany: Oh, sweet summer child
xTheNinthCloud: turn back now
wuzzum: Lol nah
Colossal89: not the live thread man
PerkyMcGiggles: You won't find that here.
dominoid73: /r/politicaldiscussion
TheTrashyOne: Lol. You're in r/politics. Of course not.
EndoExo: Actual discussion in a reddit live thread? Bruh...
Pintopinata123: You won't find that on Reddit, unfortunately. Not while it's live at least.
Rwings: All your going to find is knee jerk reactions. Won't be until people are able to digest what was said before an actual conversation can take place.
kneeonball: Keep looking, you most likely won't find it here.
Bystronicman08: No, not at all. Find somewhere else if you want unbiased comments. Seriously.
Corbanis_Maximus: You are in the wrong place then.
ShivaSkunk777: hah. hahaha.
Sterilize_a_klutz: Umm...imagine going to Yankee stadium...wearing a Sox jersey....looking to discuss baseball.
