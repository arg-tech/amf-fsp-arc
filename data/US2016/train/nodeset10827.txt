BAIER: Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions. So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person. 
Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight. 
Mr. Trump. [booing] Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage. 
TRUMP: I fully understand. 
BAIER: The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod. 
TRUMP: I fully understand. 
BAIER: And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton. 
You can't say tonight that you can make that pledge? 
TRUMP: I cannot say. I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I'm the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent. But -- and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee. 
BAIER: So tonight, you can't say if another one of these... 
PAUL: This is what's wrong!
