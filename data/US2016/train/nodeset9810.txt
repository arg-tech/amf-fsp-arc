 elkab0ng:
 I think Sanders is winning gun owners over. No dodges, no excuses.

 You can disagree with the guy, but he's consistent.

 Feral404: No. He wants to ban the most popular firearms. He would win over
 gun owners if he would drop his gun control stance.

 I love him except for his stance on the AWB.

 elkab0ng: "Well-regulated" is a thing. We can debate about what
 is good regulation and what's bad - but of the five candidates, Sanders (at
 least to my ear) was the only one who didn't seem to be doing verbal
 gymnastics to avoid some legislative history which contradicts what he's
 currently advocating.

 Gun makers are smart, they modified trigger guard designs and stock
 templates to work within the '94 law, and there has not been a single day
 that I haven't been able to pick up an AR-15 at a store in the last 30 years
 (except when they sell out everything at full list because Obama mentioned
 guns)

 chillbroswagginzz: Agreed. Unfortunately the crowd blew up for Hillary's
 insane ideas (suing gun companies for the end users actions?) and were silent
 on Sanders.

 elkab0ng: I honestly wouldn't bet on Sanders taking the nomination, but I
 have to give him points for giving straight answers.

 chillbroswagginzz: Yeah, same. If he was behaving like a proper politician
 I think he'd be super anti-gun until getting the nomination, then find a
 middle ground. Straight answers will be his downfall (or one of them) Clinton
 will play it like the politician she is.
