I've never seen a debate moderated with such an agenda in my life. Carson's comment "Thanks. I wasn't sure I was going to get a question tonight" is all you need to know. Fox News is determined to marginalize the horses in the race they don't want to back at all. Just think about that first question - a pledge not to run as an independent if you don't get the GOP nomination... it's almost like they demanded every candidate kiss the Fox News ring. And the guy that refuses is Donald Trump. What a joke of a party!!

Trump played this well. Since he is leading them there is no other choice but to give him the nomination. And if the mess with him then he will run as 3rd party. So republicans better start getting on trumps side.

At least they had a debate. The democrats are capping it at 6. I don't think anyone but Clinton will be given a chance.

Good. Carson is a Christian Ayatollah and one of the worst candidates I have ever seen with respect to how much damage could be done to the country.

This. He has no political experience and it showed tonight. If it weren't for those last few minutes his campaign would have completely died tonight I think. He knows how to easily and freely talk about Christianity but not a lot of these other things.

Look, Trump as president would be bad, but you gotta give it to him for standing up and not kissing their asses.

He refused and got thrown under a fucking tank for good measure. It's completely ridiculous.

I think they were baiting Trump from the get go so they could rattle him.

Sorry -- what a joke of a party and "news" organization.
