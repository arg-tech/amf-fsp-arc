Orangeskill: Did donald do a shit ton of coke before this?!?!
kierwest: Sounds like he has a cold.
Bebedvd: He's shaking like crazy
dominoid73: I hear a lot of people are talking about his case of the "sniffles" tonight. Good, smart people.
Kicker774: He actually seems slightly calmer than he was in the Republican debates.
Maybe chaised the coke w/ some ambien
BrainDeadNeoCon: I think he popped a couple quaaludes. Seems they started to wear off at about 20 minutes in.
CallRespiratory: The best coke, the bump was terrific. Believe me. Mexico.
fullchub: He snorted something based on those sniffles.
