 [deleted]:I''ve
 been supporting Hillary because I think she's the Dem's best chance but I
 find myself agreeing with absolutely everything Sanders' is saying. Is he
 worth it?

 EMINEM_4Evah: Don't say no. Even if you're the only vote for him, vote for
 him. If in doubt, vote for him. If we're gonna go down, fucking we'll go down
 fighting!

 152515: Absolutely. Motivating me to vote for the first time.

 telperiontree: Thank you for making my brain give Sanders a starring role
 in a L'oreal commercial.

 The answer is yes. Look him up.
