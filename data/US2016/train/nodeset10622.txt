Let him make his mistakes and stick to policy.

I'm talking about the "by the time this debate is finished, I'll be blamed for everything" lines.
Stick to policy and facts, let Trump be the ignorant talkative buffoon.

Having too much fun talking about "Trumped Up Trickle Down" knowing he'll blow up about it.
He looks like an idiotic ass, and she looks just like the establishment career politician he accuses her of being.

She can't help it, she will take the fakest road.

Mrguymanp 
To be fair some of this is gold.
"Im going to be blamed for everything"
"Why not?"
