BAIER : Governor Christie , you 're not exactly the darling of conservatives . You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state . On Facebook , the most people talking about you , not surprisingly , come from your state of New Jersey , and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy . This -- this may be why . Under your watch , New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades . The state 's 44th in private sector growth . You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country . So why should voters believe that your management of the country 's finances would be any different ? 

CHRISTIE : If you think it 's bad now , you should 've seen it when I got there . [ laught and applause ] The fact is -- the fact is , in the eight years before I became governor , taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times . In the eight years before I became governor , spending was increased 56 percent . And in the eight years before I become governor , there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey . Zero . For eight years . So , what did we do ? We came in , we balanced an $ 11 billion deficit on a $ 29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget . We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases . In fact , we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor . We cut business taxes $ 2.3 billion , and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place . And , what 's happened since ? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I 've been governor . We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey , but I am darn proud we 've brought our state back . [ applause ]
