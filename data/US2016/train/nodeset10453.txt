KELLY : Governor Walker , you 've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape , incest , or to save the life of the mother . You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother 's life , but you 're on the record as having objected to it . Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion , and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception , are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election ? 

WALKER : Well , I 'm pro-life , I 've always been pro-life , and I 've got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that ... [ applause ] ... in that I believe that that is an unborn child that 's in need of protection out there , and I 've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected , and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother . That 's been consistently proven . Unlike Hillary Clinton , who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood , I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago , long before any of these videos came out ... [ applause ] ... I 've got a position that 's in line with everyday America . [ applause ]
