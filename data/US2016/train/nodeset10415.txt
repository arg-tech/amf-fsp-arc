Am I the only one who thinks Rubio has been on point tonight?

dude i haven't heard him actually answer a single question. Every time he gets a chance to speak instead of addressing what is asked he either blatantly ignores it or goes off with irrelevant points that his campaign runs on while barely touching what was asked

He's been almost reasonable which is more than I can say for the other 16

No he's doing really well. Even as a democrat I am finding myself nodding along with him ironically. If the Republicans have any brains they would elect him as their candidate. Especially, if Hillary is the Democrat as he feels (not is, but feels) the opposite of her and could look far more humble.

(Edited): I think he is. I'm disappointed, though, at the extent to which all these candidates have fallen into line with the Republican Base's chapter and verse.

He hasn't hurt his cause but he hasn't really stood out to me.

He's education point was cringe worthy
