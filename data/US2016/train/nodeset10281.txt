jimmb06: fun fact,The top 10 percent of income earners paid 68 percent of all federal income taxes in 2011 (the latest year available), though they earned 45 percent of all income. The bottom 50 percent paid 3 percent of income taxes, but earned 12 percent of income. I'd love to see a retort to this, as i know a lot of you are for MORE of this.
liamliam1234liam: Because the bottom fifty percent cannot afford it? There is no retort. It absolutely should be that way. In the fifties and sixties the income tax rate on the nation's wealthiest citizens was ninety percent, and as a result the country as a whole was much more successful. I guess you can try to argue fairness, but I do not think it is fair for some people to have nothing while others have everything and then try to prevent you from spreading some of that everything to the people who have nothing.

Also, when I refer to national success, I mean the middle class was far stronger (comparatively wealthier, had more employment benefits despite no real difference in relative pay, etc.), and the poor were also not struggling as much (although it was still generally bad for them).
