Trump claiming he hasn't gone bankrupt? Uh...

kidcrumb
Well technically "he" hasnt.
The entire line of questioning is rediculous. It doesnt matter if a few of Trumps companies declare bankruptcy. He doesnt personally manage all of his investments. Even if his name is on the building its management is all delegated.

He hasn't, his company did.

Thats him saying he hasn't filed a personal Ch7. Why would he? His personal assets are shielded..lol
