 DJVT7:
 This debate is very one sided.. (Bernie/Hillary and everyone else) no one
 else gets that much time to speak, it's a bit unfair.

 MiamiFootball: it's pre-decided and based on polling 

 DJVT7: That makes sense but I honestly haven't heard of the other three
 candidates before tonight, I would personally like to hear what the other
 candidates would like to say

 [deleted]: I'm a Bernie fan and I think it's one sided, and only in
 Hillary's favor. She's had impeccable speech skills that are going to impress
 viewers a lot more than Bernie's huge fuck ups and stumbling this whole
 debate. People who were off the wall with Bernie worrying he might be senile
 are only given fuel to the fire with his spacing out and
 "ums"

 DJVT7: It really is, he is not a good debater, but he's making a lot of
 good points when talking about the
 issues. I personally do not like Hillary's demeanor, not agreeing with a lot
 of her responses and very "structured and cookie cutter-esque."
 She's forming her responses to get the crowd going.
