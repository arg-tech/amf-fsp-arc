 RAND PAUL JUST EYEROLLED 9/11

 BUT CHRISTIE IS USING IT FOR POLITICAL GAIN

 I DON'T KNOW WHO I HATE MORE.

 beverlycrushher: I never thought the words "9/11 card" would come
 out of my mouth and I am equally ashamed.

 [deleted]: He eyerollled Christie.

 ApolloX-2: That fat shit who uses the deaths on 9/11 for leverage on a
 debate.

 AwkwardBurritoChick: Why not both? The GOP seems to be the snake eating
 it's own tail in this debate. The first debate was so non-eventful, this one
 - it's just packed. I may need to call out of work tomorrow due to drinking
 words. Now Cruz, pulling the eyebrow game with his rhetoric.

 mrburns88: not watching, what do you mean "eyerolled"?

 WineAndWhiskey: Legitimately eye rolled when it was mentioned.

 mrburns88:it's pretty ridiculous that politicians are still using it for
 justification

 TheNumberMuncher: He eye rolled Christie

 Paladin327: Christie, the answer is christie
