This debate ain't fair. Trump is not expected to perform well, since he's not a politician, while Clinton is expected to perform well. Trump can do horrible and still win the debate.

You're right - it's not fair. Moderator three questions only targeting trump including birther questions, tax return questions and stop and frisk.

Also, Trump has no record. He can easily lie about supporting the Iraqi war. Clinton doesn't have that luxury.

Well luckily Trump hasn't even performed as well as the low bar that was set for him.

When has that mattered with his supporters?

They are already frothing at the mouth. Trump needs undecided voters. Pandering to his base ain't the way to do it.
