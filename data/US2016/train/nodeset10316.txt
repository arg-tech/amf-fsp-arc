 pppparf: as a brit, i must wonder. wtf is wrong with the republicans? you have one
 candidate who's entire policy on illegal immigrants is to build a fucking
 wall. as funny as it is, it's just totally going to be a one horse
 race.

 just talk fiscally conservatively. and please nothing on abortion

 they've had 8 years to find one guy to do that

 EarthExile: Are you still laughing as three more people also support the
 Wall?

 socialistbob: He will flame out soon. This is the time when Herman Cain and
 Michelle Bachmann were leading last time around.

 Giant_Asian_Slackoff: 

 Trust me, many Americans wonder the same thing. Please don't judge us, I
