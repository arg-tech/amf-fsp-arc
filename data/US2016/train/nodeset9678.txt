[deleted]: Sanders is a broken record
HanginWithDaleCooper: Every candidate is if you listen to them everyday. Today is about exposing your message to the people who don't follow the news everyday.
SonicFrost: All of them are, I'm pretty sure they all just regurgitated the same positions in different words. Though Sanders was a little different with the incarceration rate.
This is for all the people who don't know them though, not the ones who do.
Juicemourne: That's what happens when people don't change their minds.
uhyoudonebrah: He's just reiterating what a lot of Americans aren't getting or choosing to ignore.
[deleted] No I think hes saying the same thing over and over agin because it sounds nice...despite having no feasible plan to fix it that wouldnt bust up the economy
uhyoudonebrah: He has general outlines, such as what he has been preaching ever since he was a senator. Can you give me a specific outlined plan by any other candidate? Thought not.
