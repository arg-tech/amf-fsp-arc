Pokemongotrainer: And he never did
Solario_ff14: But he did: massive trade war starting tariffs.
SerHodorTheThrall: He did though. He's saying Tariffs will cause companies to reopen plants and jobs here.
He may or may not be wrong, but he did answer the question.
canofaerosol: "We have to stop them from leaving." I think that's a well and thoroughly thought out plan.
Ajwf: Well technically tariffing the fuck out of any trade would cause an increase in domestic jobs... just nothing else productive.
thewarmpandabear: Listen, we can't let the jobs leave, ok? We're losing jobs like crazy and, I'm telling ya, we can't let them leave. Mexico, China, look at them. All our jobs. It's about keeping the jobs here. Crazy.
MBTAHole: He did. He is talking about raising import tariffs which deincentivise companies from manufacturing overseas. He didn't answer it in a way that Joe 6 Pack can understand though.
