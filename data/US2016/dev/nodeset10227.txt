 Holy shit. Anderson Cooper giving a little knowledge drop by telling the
 viewers what Glass Steagall is so it's more than just a talking point, and
 something people actually know what the candidates are talking about.

 Anderson is really doing a great job as moderator of this debate. He's
 really providing a good platform for this debate.

 exitpursuedbybear:

 Even Elizabeth Warren admits now that glass steagal would not have been
 enough to stop the 08 collapse.

 burntfuck: "Elizabeth Warren is not a candidate
 exitpursuedbybear!" -AC

 kangawu: Cooper for Grand President of Presidential Debates 2016

 MY_NAME_IS_IN_CAPS: Anderson is killing it as moderator.

 Ajwf: My only issue is he gets caught up with Webb over time but won't cut
 off Clinton.

 SweeterThanYoohoo: This was
 extremely noticeable. While Webb was a bit childish in his continued
 insistence in bringing up time, he was damn root.

 linkprovidor: Webb tried to ask for more time rather than just keep
 talking.

 It's the classic ask for forgiveness not permission thing.

 ncocca: She just talked louder. Fuck it, cut her mic

 ThirdMostAverage: Cutting mics should totally be a thing in debates

 UnrulyEnormity: Bring back the talking stick.

 DrMobius: oh poor trump

 Seakawn: Damn... this is actually a really great suggestion. I wish they'd
 do that. But that'd probably be a little too progressive and productive of a
 thing to implement.

 MY_NAME_IS_IN_CAPS: I mean, would you want the future president to remember
 you as the guy who cut your mic off while you were talking? Good luck getting
 into the white house press briefings if he or she has a long memory.

 whiteflagwaiver: AS an 18 yr/o viewer, I have to thank him.

 martymcflyer: Many might make some snide comment about your age being
 irrelevant, but I for one am glad you aren't apathetic about politics at your
 age!

 whiteflagwaiver: Things are not going to change if my generation decides to
 sit on their hands and think voting isnt important.

 Lets just hope sooner rather than later the young vote wake up.

 nfactor: Agree. He isn't letting them get away with not answering the
 question either. Great moderator.

 mwax321: Secretary Clinton, Clinton, Clinton, CLINTON, FINAL WARNING OR YOU
 WILL BE COOPERIZED!!!!

 gbuck97: Props to my US History Teacher for actually making me remember
 that and how it was repealed by Clinton.

 Roygbiv856: Also dropped the population of Denmark off the top of his head.
 Not bad at all
