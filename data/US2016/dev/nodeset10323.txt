 Did Trump take credit for making immigration an issue, and admit he will be
 an asshole if elected?

 tatostix: yes

 johnconnor8100: Why do you think people like him he is an asshole and owns
 it

 swd120: better the devil you know than the devil you don't

 All the other candidates talk in polished political doublespeak - you don't
 know where they really stand - Hillary does it too...

 There are two candidates that are speaking their minds without all the
 bullshit (for better or worse) and they are Trump and Bernie

 g_mo821: speak his mind

 gingerjojo: Yuuuuuup.
