 [deleted]: What are your views on an abortion exception for women who were
 victims of rape?

 "I THINK THEY NEED TO HAVE THE CHILD AND RAISE IT AND THAT CHILD
 BETTER LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE RAPIST SO EVERYDAY THE MOTHER WAKES UP REMINDED
 THAT SHE WAS RAPED ONLY TO LOOK AT THE RAPIST IN THE EYES AND HAVE TO RAISE
 HIM"

 Hallopainyo: He never said that. You're putting words in his mouth.

 Canada_girl: It was implied.

 [deleted]: It's implied when they ask if you would allow for a rape
 exception and you say "Hell No"

 ThatPersonGu: I read that as "I'M SO PRO-LIFE, I'LL KILL A BITCH AND
 FUCK HILARY."

 [deleted]: TL;DR: the entire debate.
