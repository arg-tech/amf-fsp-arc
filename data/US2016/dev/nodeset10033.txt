Irving94: Bernie spaced the fuck out there.
dichloroethane: Gettin old 
lurklurklurky: We all did, let's be real
Erra0: Webb makes me sleepy
19t: Odd. Is he not powerful enough for you? How about Chaffee?
ImLikeAnOuroboros: Oh man that was great
theturbolemming: Yeah, he wasn't paying any attention to Webb (who can blame him) and it sure came back to bite him. That was a rough moment.
dimsumx: Was anyone paying attention when Webb was talking?
solmakou: There was no reason for him to be called there, I have no idea why he was called on..
Teh_Slayur: Same. It was completely out of the blue.
evnalmightyyy: Exactly what I got, he was just " why would I have something to say in return?"
jonnyozero3: Anderson probably noticed he wasn't paying attention and tried to call him on it.
ati_exorcist: I think Anderson was trying to get the discussion back on topic and Sanders had to remember what that was.
wigshaker: Absolutely.
zaiaza: Because they wanted to make debate and get people angry.
js155306: Because he's onstage promoting himself as a candidate for the highest office in the country?
HoldenFinn: Seriously. I don't know why you were downvoted. He should have been focusing on what was going on literally right in front of him.
The_Juggler17: It has always been clear that he doesn't rehearse canned answers, he doesn't have a scripted response to certain questions.
He's just saying what he actually thinks, thinking on his feet. That doesn't look as polished, but it's genuine.
money_run_things: yeah he did
KokiriResident: Haha it was pretty clear he had no idea where the debate was when his name was called
FrostySt: 
"Bernie?"
"......Come again?"
dick_wool: He needs to stop spending so much time in legal weed states. j/k
artyfoul: 
"Sorry, I was to busy checking out berniesanders.com to listen to my good friend Jim Webb"
grin and turn to camera
JohnStamosBRAH: It was a super vague question from Andy.
Zewstain: I honestly didn't know if he was supposed to follow up on Webbs China sea bit, or go back to Hillarys which is what he was going to.
