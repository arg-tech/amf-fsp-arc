 I still can't believe that guy admitted to voting for something he didn't
 know about hahah

 GenericReditAccount: They may never come back to him. Haha. Poor guy

 Tuatho: The only difference between him and the vast majority of others is
 that he admitted it. It's sad he's gonna be roasted for being honest. I've
 met senators, a lot of them have no fucking clue and their shit's being run
 for them.

 derpaderp: Oh for sure but it would have been easy to say "it was my
 first day. I trusted day advisors"

 [deleted]: By far the funniest part
 of the whole debate - IDK it was my first day lulz cut me some slack

 elkab0ng: I think what we just saw right there was career death on national
 TV. Good god that was horrible.
