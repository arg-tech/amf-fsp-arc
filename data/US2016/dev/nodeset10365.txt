manchegan: That's a regressive tax
Todo88: Just legalize weed. It's helped offset out lack of income tax here in Washington state.
manchegan: Google "Washington state budget" then "Washington marijuana revenues". Sorry to burst your bubble.
Todo88: I didn't say they cancelled out. That'd be pretty foolish, just that it helps offset our regressive tax.
redditor77492: Oh, no doubt about it! Just wondering how much extra we're talking for the lowest 20% of earners would be paying on food and school supplies. 20%? 30%? Are welfare benefits going to go up 40%+ to compensate? (($100 - $30) * 1.42 = $100)
