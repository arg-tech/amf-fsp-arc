 Andewz111:
 Three times so far tonight he's said he's been waiting for 10 minutes.
 Someone fact check this! Keep a stopwatch on how long he's been actually
 waiting.

 Oh! A fourth time!

 Her0_0f_time: Well it has been about 30 minutes...so it cant be that far
 off.

 CunderscoreF: 4 times!

 Calvengeance: "Andewz111, we've
 reviewed and it seems he has been waiting for a total of only 8 minutes. More
 after these messages."

 Andewz111: Four Pinocchios on the Washington Post scale!
