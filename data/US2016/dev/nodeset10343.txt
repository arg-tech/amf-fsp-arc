ThatPersonGu:Holy shit Christe's trying so hard to push that 9/11 cred to support the NSA.
sddnpoopxplsndss: He is trying too hard --- and he wants to make all marijuana illegal based on nothing but his own opinion. 
MotorboatingSofaB: And unlimited 128oz drinks at 7-11 for everyone
HoneyD: Liberal fascists want to take away our god damn big gulps!
availableoregonOregon: You mean he's channeling a textbook case of how not to win the presidency?
plasker6: It was such a bad attack the NSA or DEA will now have to approve every article in the press. All Muslims are going to internment camps. My hands are tied.
Rooster_Ties: Say what you want, but I thought Christie's responses all night came off as being pretty strong. I wouldn't want him as president (nor any of the republicans), but I thought Christie - along with Kasich - were the two Republicans that helped themselves the most last night.
Crossignal: Except he didn't hug people on 9/11. Christi was not Governor, he was not even Attorney General on 9/11. Christi tried to pull a fast one.
Barney21: Well if it will prevent Christie from hugging people, the NSA is welcome to read my emails.
FUCKYOUINYOURFACE: "Remember 9/11? They don't do terrorist attacks like they used to. I was alive then" ~ Chris Christie
damnit_darrell: Ikr? Paul fucked him up.
[deleted]: Really? Paul kinda rambled about ideology that couldn't be realized.
damnit_darrell: Maybe so, but it was infinitely better than Christie's attempt to garner the I &lt;3 9/11 victims angle to justify mass surveillance of everyone. Although Paul did miss a great opportunity to get him on a lack of belief in habeas corpus at the end.
CyberianSun: Not sure he had the time right as Christie finished the remark they moved into the next question as the back and forth and been going on for a while at that point.
[deleted]: Paul had a good point, but he said it terribly. I mean, "track the terrorists and not the citizens" is full of so many holes it's not funny.
damnit_darrell: Yeup. Paul's whole point of mass surveillance is that warrants need to be individualized for individual people as opposed to groups or companies or corporations. I know that because I've been following him since before he announced and he didn't articulate it that way last night. That being said I still think he came out on top over Christie in that exchange.
[deleted]: Coming on top over angry 9/11 pseudohero is not hard. But his personal image wasn't improved, and he had a gigantic chance to do so.
winplease: he remembers hugging those families
jhc1415: The attack on him for hugging Obama was just as crazy. The reason he hugged Obama was because he came to NJ to help out after hurricane Sandy destroyed towns. The way every other republican is ridiculing him for that is insane. He's the POTUS, not satan. It's ok to show a little respect sometimes.
winplease: I cannot believe that they attacked Obama for going out there to support people who have lost everything in the hurricane
telldatbitchtobecool: Just like when they attacked Obama for bowing "too deeply" to the Japanese. Even showing respect is disrespectful when you have a fundamental dislike for the person's skin color politics...
kcnc: I wish he had responded with that instead of with the 9/11 hugs. Shame the others a little bit for looking down on him working with the president to show support during a terrible time.
chestypants12: He's the only candidate who can hug several families at the same time. (he's a large man)
taco-superfood: Does Christie have a position on giving nutjobs air time on CSPAN? No? Sorry, not relevant.
Fallout99: Wait was he appointed as the attorney general on 9/10/2001? I havent heard that before s/
coooolbeans: Apparently that's not even true. His appointment was announced Dec. 7, 2001. Source
GluggGlugg: Loved Paul's eye roll response
cnosko00: Here yo go http://i.imgur.com/AGuA1Kl.jpg
AnneBancroftsGhost: Thank you. I must have been so busy rolling my own eyes that I missed that.
CaptainSolo96Michigan: Heard that shit argument before
The_Brat_Prince: I liked his bit about hugging the families of the victims of 9/11 after Paul told him to go hug Obama some more
AsthmaticMechanic: Playing the "people I know died in 9/11" card was pretty fucking low. Though I too rolled my eyes, it probably wasn't wise for Paul to do that on stage...with the camera right on him.Just a tad insensitiv e.
jham2015: I'm genuinely confused how people think that Christe got the best of Paul on NSA.
