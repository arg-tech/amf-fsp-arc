 JohnStamosBRAH:
 Did Bernie say cost of college today is the cost of high school years ago?
 What does that mean?

 E: got it folks, thank you!

 jackruby83: Not the cost, but kind of "experience
 equivalent"

 exitpursuedbybear: I think he means it's equivalent worth.

 craponyourdeskdawg: He means everyone should be able to go to college

 cyberslick188: I'm assuming he meant value.

 executivemonkey: He said that a college degree today provides the same
 opportunities as a high school degree did 50 years ago.

 Bashnek: i think he said College today is the equivalent of high school 50
 years ago, 50 years ago finishing high was seen as the standard of education
 and was somewhat "expected" of people. Nowadays college is seen as
 that standard.

 i think. maybe.

 yay_dinosaurs: I think he meant "value", not cost

 phaionix: He said that a college degree is as important to your future
 today as the high school diploma was 50 years ago.

 pHbasic: Equivalent. Like you have about the same economic outcomes

 Mr_Jensen: I think he meant in terms of what the degrees means to
 employers. A college degree today is worth what a high school degree was
 worth decades ago.
