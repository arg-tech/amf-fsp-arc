thebabybananagrabber: everyone out there is the anti bernie......
BIGGNIG: A capitalist? Wow, shocking.
Duffalpha: No, a guy who speaks directly about the issues the other politicians are clearly uninterested in discussing due to personal bias. Trump just has the polar opposite opinions on most issues...
He's still the only one up there saying: yall motherfuckers are bought and paid for.
Teh_Slayur: Except: Trump used to be for single-payer and pro-choice. Now that he's running for president, suddenly he's anti-choice and doesn't even support Obamacare. He acts like he's some kind of maverick, but he isn't. He just uses over-the-top bigoted comments to attract the attention of bigoted voters.
Duffalpha: Dude obviously.
But I don't mind having a guy on stage who can say things like: "paying you guys is the only way to get things done".
It's nice to have as much of that voice as possible at that freak show
blacksheepcannibal: I have my sneaking suspicion that the only reason Trump is running is to make it so Bernie has a chance.
DustyDGAF: What a fucking dream that would be.
