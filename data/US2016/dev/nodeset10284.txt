 Cost of solar is less expensive than coal. If we invested 10 percent of our
 GDP into that we will be entirely solar by 2025. 2050 is going to happen
 anyway. Sooner the better

 tschandler71: Invested 10 percent? Are you nuts?

 rowdyroddypiperjr: I know that's a lot but free energy was my point. They
 are discussing 5 percent based on the 10 percent that solar panels currently
 do. Solar city is stating they can get 20 percent. That is a super safe
 answer was my point.

 tschandler71: You realize how much 20 percent of GDP is exactly? Government
 only consumes around 17 percent currently for all things including debt
 service.

 rowdyroddypiperjr: Wow lol yes I do. I said 10 percent and that was based
 on current energy use and current solar technology. I just wanted to point it
 that it's less expensive to make solar plants than coal ones. I just used
 those numbers because it's easy math. That's why said 10 percent
