Jagerblue: Hilary, how would you be different from Obama?
Well.. he's a black man and I'm a white woman! crowd applauds
What the hell kind of answer is that lol
antihexe: Panderingggg.
meta_perspective: I can't answer questions Tldr:
I hate the NRA
Wall Street is to blame
I support this party line opinion
My dad died
flying87: I killed a guy
ForlornWife: Seriously! What a gross answer.
ncolaros: It's kind of a dumb question. All candidates have talked about how different they are from Obama. It's impossible to answer in 15 seconds. No one had a good answer.
Jagerblue: Agreed! I just felt like she was the only one who didn't even try, she quickly retconned with a small brief answer though, which I can respect lol
ncolaros: Yeah that wasn't her high point for sure.
TheBlackSpank: I think it's a reasonable question. They're just asking how the candidate would do a better job than the current president. We're trying to elect the best person for the job.
Miscreant3: Still, "I have a vagina" was probably the worst answer to that.
loki8481: it's probably the kind of answer that's going to keep people who like Obama and the job that he's done inside her camp, especially if Biden doesn't run.
Oreo_Speedwagon: She just doubled down on it. She's not an insider in Washington! Because she's a girl!
Batatata: I can't believe people were that dumb to clap for that. She is the definition of an establishment, insider candidate.
iyaerP: The only way she could be more of an establishment canidate would be if she did a fusion dance with one of the Kennedies to form SUPER SAIYAN KENNELINTON.
jrafferty: The only way she could be more of an establishment canidate would be if she did a fusion dance with one of the Kennedies to form SUPER SAIYAN KENNELINTON. had a penis
FTFY
Seakawn: It's hard for me to be convinced that you can't believe people were that dumb to clap for that. I guess you don't realize how dumb our population generally is? The applause she got, especially there, wasn't comfortable for me, but it also wasn't out of the ordinary. I can absolutely believe people were naive enough to think it deserved applause.
Batatata: You are right. I wasn't surprised. I'm just pissed at it.
TRIPYF1SH: As a girl I couldn't possibly have been a part of government, Obviously.
Turns around and shows how qualified she is because of her political career.
phunky_monk: You could say it was...Hilaryous.
heinsickle31: Dad?
Dad_Jokes_Incoming: What's 50 Cent's name in Zimbabwe? 400 Million Dollars.
heinsickle31: STOP EMBARRASING ME IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS GOSH
SgtDowns: This was such a disgusting attempt to pander to women voters. It's similar to her "I'm not running just because my name is Clinton". WTF.
0454: And yet people buy it, especially women. Republican religious nuts aren't the only stupid voters.
BernieMessiahSavior: They're be some borderline conservative women that will go along with it. They won't tell anyone they know of course. It's pretty smart.
Wormhog: Wouldn't go that far. Was it the best answer she could have given? No. Does it matter to women in this country if they are represented in a government that continually tries to dictate what we can and can't do with our uteruses and tries to defund clinics providing birth control and reproductive health screenings to low-income women? Yes. Does she have my vote? Not in the primary.
SgtDowns: Did you watch the debate? There were numerous times where she alluded to her gender regardless of the question. I agree it's important they have representation but many issues were across genders but she referenced it regardless.
hatesspaceinvaders: Then after the break when Anderson jokingly welcomed her back she said 'it takes me a bit longer teehee' number one ew, two WE GET IT YOU'RE A LADY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING PEE INTO THIS.
badp4nd4: Hillary; "Vote for me, I am facing serious federal felony charges.. but look, I have a vagina..."
vectorlit: This straight up pissed my wife off
Seakawn: Good, that means your wife is intelligent. But Hillary did this not to get her vote, but for all the women who admired her response, because that's a lot more people than who your wife is representative of.
Jockobutters: All the other candidates could have just replied, "I'm a white man."
Chubby_Chasers: Don't vote for my name, vote for my vagina.
kernelhoops: What's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
[deleted]: Otherwise good performance but this answer boiled down to "I have a vagina"
bombahdeer: My jaw dropped when I heard that one. All this time I though she was a man.
smith-smythesmith: The answer was expected. I was embarrassed for the crowd.
California_Viking:What would you differently?
I am a women!
Obama trusted me.
Everyone changes their mind.
Republicans.
Those were her talking points .
Liberi_Fatales: The kind of answer that appeals to old white women and tumblrinas
living_on_purpose: I physically shuddered when she said that.
wrc-wolf: She immediately followed it up saying how she would stay the course of the Obama admin. She's answering a non-question with a non-answer.
Seems-Reasonable: I lost so much respect for her. I voted for her in the primary in 2008. She is really different since then. Ugh. It's sad.
[deleted]: and yet people still think shes remotely worthy of presidency.
