Why does this feel so dirty?
[deleted]: he's a little bit Jesse Ventura, a little bit "Rookie of the Year" and all sleaze.
eifer: oh my god I'm loving trump right now.. I was wrong about him. He adds something to this process, he doesn't detract from it.
itzkittenz: Plz no
Manning01: You can tell he has absolutely no advisers or political team and is just shooting from the hip.
Atheose_Writing: And I'm loving every sarcastic moment of it.
Redditor_exe: I love it
imoses44: That hip is due for surgery
Webonics: BAM I'll build a wall based on the statement of some guy.
BAM Women's issues aren't issues.
Who's next!?
austrologi:After hearing all these bullshit #hashtag movements, I am glad someone is willing to dismiss them outright instead of pretending they are sane and rational.
fittitthroway:It's legitimately refreshing
Alienm00se: I feel like he must have one but I'll bet they know the best strategy they can suggest is for him to just keep doing what he's been doing and not worry about a damned thing. Why try to fix whats working already?
FUCKYOUINYOURFACE: He doesn't need those losers. He would just fire them. Trump isn't stupid. He knows what exactly the fuck he's doing. He knows the base. This is fun for him.
cBlackout: I like to think that Ted Cruz has all his notecards that he rehearses backstage while he rubs grease through his hair, so that when he's on stage he's perfectly prepared to dodge any question they throw at him. Trump, on the other hand, I suspect does a line off a stripper's ass and then just walks out ready to wing it and kill everybody in the room with that Trump brand ridiculousness.
Relishboy: Watching this for free feels criminal.
I've paid for less entertainment
slicknav: Because the next president of the US could very well be a reality TV star
ItsBobDoleYo: shh shhh shhh don't fight it just let it happen
YoungCinny: Because he doesn't give a shit. He answers to no one because he's self funded
sarais: He answers to no one
Unfortunately that would extend to his constituents.
ShellInTheGhost: There's a lot of things Trump is. Bought is not one of them.
YoungCinny: How can you buy a man worth 10b+... its a weird kind of catch 22 where the president needs to be unbuyable but also shouldn't need billions to run
[deleted]: Part of me admires someone not willing to slime themselves up in front of the camera though. His policy is for the most part bunk but it's awesome seeing a guy that can't be bought having his way with the system
i_drink_wd40: Because you're looking into the abyss, buddy.
Chanman_614: I enjoy it as well. As long as he doesn't get elected president, I want more of him on my television.
brent0935: I feel like he's the reason this debate feels a lot like a free-for-all
Copperhead61: I think the Onion summed it up pretty well.
CQME: Isn't the Onion supposed to be satire? That read like Trump's actual candidacy, IMHO.
BeautifulMania: Oh my god I never realized how badly I wanted this.
greasywiener: Dude/dudette, I know. I went in ready to hate him, and while I still can't agree with any of his ideology, he's just going balls out and not making any apologies.
mikeanderson401: The truth is dirty and gonna feel nasty when you first hear it
