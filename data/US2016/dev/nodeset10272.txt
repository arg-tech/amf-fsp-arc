 Lincoln Chafee just isn't presidential material. He seems more like a cool
 college professor.

 antihexe: I'd argue that he's president material, he's just not figurehead
 material. If elections weren't just popularity contests he'd probably do just
 fine.

 beach-bum: I get your point, he does have good positions, I was speaking
 more of his presentation.

 Calvengeance: "Extra credit if you write 420 blaze 4 dayz on your
 paper."

 AndrewWS100: he is very charasmatic, but i see what you're saying.
