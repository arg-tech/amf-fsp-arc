 Todo88:
 Gettem Rand

 kevo7777: The only one I don't absolutely hate. I'm not voting for him, but
 still.

 Todo88: Rand vs. Bernie is my pipe-dream. I don't see it happening, but
 that's my ideal.

 kevo7777: Agreed. It won't happen, but if it the 15% flat tax would do Rand
 in for the loss.

 GaB91: That's fine. It would still be the best scenario for the country.
