 I couldn't start watching until a while ago, so this is late, but in the
 Syria section, did O'Malley say "Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen
 as a blunder"?

 zefy_zef: yea i think i saw that

 [deleted]Yes. People misspeak.

 MuffinsAndBiscuits: Yeah, it's not a criticism. I just thought I was crazy
 for a second and it did sent me into a wikipedia hunt to figure out what
 Assad's dad did.

 [deleted]:Haha, nice. He was basically Assad senior. Evil dictator who
 bulldozed his people when they got too uppity.
