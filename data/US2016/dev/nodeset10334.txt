 I didn't realize 9/11 happened in New Jersey.

 MrWWonka: my GOD i hate Chubs Chrustie

 MoeKin: Christie is bigger than Jersey

 unluckycowboy: Ted and Barney are furious right now

 Ziddletwix: Would it really have been any better had it been New York
 instead? I find his 9/11 pandering a sad way of avoiding about talking about
 anything with substance. But I'd feel the exact same way had he been mayor of
 New York at the time... New Jersey was certainly effected by 9/11, but the
 fact that you saw it first hand is irrelevant to what we are talking about
 here.

 Barney21: My sister lives in New Jersey and she could see it from her
 porch.
