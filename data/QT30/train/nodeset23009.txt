Ian Murray[0:07:58] You haven't given an explanation why it has taken until mid-February to make the decisions. If what you said is true, and I have no reason to believe it is not true, that we imported the variants, why has it taken the Scottish government as well as the UK government to 15 February when it comes in to do anything about it?Jeane Freeman[0:08:20] You'll know that not all the powers are devolved to Scotland.Ian Murray[0:08:26] You have the decision now.Jeane Freeman[0:08:28] We are trying to reach an agreement across the four nations. We have taken the approach as others have from the outset, where we can get four-nation agreement -- where we are now is we can't be wait any longer for this. We've learned those lessons from the summer and we're saying now that we need to prevent international travel from any country into Scotland, and that means we do have to look at what our options are in the land border because the UK government won't go far enough.Ian Murray[0:08:58] It is a decision you made. It is a decision where the Scottish Parliament has the power to make it.
