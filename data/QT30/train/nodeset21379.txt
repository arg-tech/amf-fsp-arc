Professor Devi Sridhar[00:09:48] Yeah. I think what we have to remember is that most countries in the world have border restrictions. This is a debate happening across the world. And actually if I look at South Korea, they said don't go abroad from March 2020. If I want to travel to India today I cannot, they will not let me in because I am not a national of that country. So I think right now Britain is in a great position, and full credit to Minister Zahawi for the vaccine programme, but why would we endanger that by actually having open movement of individuals in and out when we still have a lot of people unvaccinated, we still have a new variant that we don't fully understand in terms of immune protection, and so I think right now we should be cautious and tell people stay at home. Also, I'm from Miami. I miss the sunshine, I miss the blue skies. I haven't seen my family in a year and a half. But we are in an emergency situation. There is massive unemployment, there are more kids that have been out of school and disadvantaged. There are real problems, and I'm willing to say actually I'd rather focus on those as a society than put aside and say I will see my family, and until then it's WhatsApp and Facetime.
