Fiona Bruce[0:10:36] Let's get started. Our first question tonight is from Aneel James.

AudienceMember 20211111QT01[0:10:42] Has Tory sleaze returned?

Fiona Bruce[0:10:46] Caroline Lucas.

Caroline Lucas[0:10:50] Yes, it has returned, on steroids, I'm afraid. It really has been shocking to see the way in which Owen Paterson has been defended by the Prime Minister that, in a sense, we've abolished any kind of independent system of dealing with MPs' misconduct and instead we have the prospects of a new committee that was going to be a kangaroo court. There was going to be a built-in government majority on the new committee.
