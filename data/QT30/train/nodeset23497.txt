Fiona Bruce[0:41:02] Let's hear from some of these people.
AudienceMember 20211111QT14[0:41:06] Personal responsibility is important. Where's the emphasis being placed on corporate responsibility who create the most emissions.
Fiona Bruce[0:41:14] I'll come back to that. Yes, the Woman in the yellow top.
AudienceMember 20211111QT15[0:41:18] Is given that China and Russia are not admonishing seize how significant is that in those countries for creating change.
AudienceMember 20211111QT16[0:41:28] One of the issues I have is the politicians are making these pledges, they're not backed by anything, they are just weak promises. The problem we have is lot of the leaders are using this as a photo opportunity. The chancellor brings forward a green budget box. A few weeks ago in his budget box, which was a different colour, he was cutting the tax that people pay for domestic flight. Domestic flights is the worst possible way that you can move around. It doesn't join up with the pledges they are making now.
Paul Scully[0:42:02] COP is not a moment in time. It is a long time getting to this culmination. When we took over the presidency there was 20 or 30 percent -- 20 countries, rather, that had adopted a net zero plan. They are now up to 90. We are starting to build up that crescendo. We know that Paris was a time to set those targets but now is the time where we are starting to outline what action is going to be taken.
