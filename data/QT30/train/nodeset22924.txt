Part 13Fiona Bruce [00:15:56] The important thing -- the question is has leaving the European Union helped in speeding up the process. The health Secretary said we all do the safety checks but we have been able to speed it up because of Brexit. Is that right?
Michelle Donelan [00:16:14] As I said, the Europeans have collectively utilised one regulator, we have our own regulator and they adopted different processes here. We have given them rolling results throughout --
Fiona Bruce [00:16:26] Have we been able to do it more quickly?
Michelle Donelan [00:16:30] Yes, we have been able to do it more quickly because of rolling results, they tested it sequentially, that speeded up the process. But it hasn’t cut corners around the safety. That is why we can be confident this vaccine will work, it will be effective and it won’t have the side effects you might worry about thinking golly, this has been done so quickly.
