Kate Andrews[0:44:48] I'm not sure any rational person would agree with every single one of their claims. They come up with some pretty extreme stuff that isn't necessarily backed by the scientific community, and on top of that, let's point out another reason that energy bills are going up, it's because renewables, wind and solar, this past month, this past few months haven't been as reliable as they have been in the past. It hasn't been as windy, we haven't had as much sun. Now, as somebody who would love to be able to move to a completely renewable system, who doesn't want a greener world, we're being a bit dishonest with ourselves about where we're actually at and what we can achieve. The only way we get to net zero by 2050, the only way we do this properly is if we bring people with us, and we need to be honest about the fact that we have been focused on decarbonisation quite rightly, but the UK more so than a lot of other European countries has undermined its own energy security. We had far less gas reserve in the UK than Germany or France or Italy did, we're in a real bind now, so we need to have this honest conservation, and we might applaud their end goal, but I don't think it's fair to say that any rational person thinks that we should just adopt their policies overnight, whether they sit on the M25 or not. It's that dishonesty that's partially gotten us into this energy crisis to begin with.
