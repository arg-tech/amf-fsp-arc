Fiona Bruce [00:49:24] I’m going to take another question. I want to squeeze it in if I can, from James Allcock.[James]: Furlough is vital but only if there remains a company to be furloughed from. Rishi Sunak said he would do whatever it would take to support SMEs. When did the government change attack on this, and why? Fiona Bruce [00:49:44] James, you run a pub?[James]: A small restaurant. Yes. I mean all the packages from the chancellor are fine but I have been there press conference after press conference wondering is Rishi Sunak going to appear, what is he going to offer. While the packages are better than nothing, they’re not enough. Let me tell you, I had to get Universal Credit at the start of this pandemic. Apparently I have to give the money back now because I earn too much. Well, I don’t earn too much. Rishi Sunak needs to either sharpen his pencil and get with the programme or get back home and get by on 80 percent of his income for himself and sit on furlough. Because it’s no picnic.
