Bonnie Greer[0:59:02] A lot of what Dan is saying I agree with. I'm not a politician, I don't know all these figures. All I can say is I come from a country where there are 500,000 people dead because there is no health service. There is is no ethos of service. People are on the frontline, they are working hard, but there is not a central ethos. The NHS is a miracle. Trust me. And I think sometimes people don't understand. They may take it a little bit for granted. It doesn't exist anywhere else in the rest of the world. A lot of stuff that happened here that's good is because the NHS has been in business since 1948 and collecting cohort. They know how to line things up.
