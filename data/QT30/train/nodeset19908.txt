Part 32
Fiona Bruce [00:44:50] Are you not concerned, as far as goods are concerned, in that Northern Ireland is in the market for goods, frictionless trade with the EU is a lot more straightforward for Northern Ireland so it pushes them a little bit closer to Dublin? 
Brandon Lewis [00:45:04] No, because you have unfettered access into Great Britain as well. So you have the ability to trade both ways. That gives Northern Ireland a competitive advantage. A huge opportunity. Once we come out of-COVID, I appreciate. We have seen over the last year over 3 billion pounds of support that Northern Ireland has had as part of the United Kingdom. But all of us in the United Kingdom are important. I disagree entirely with George Osborne. This matters for the whole of the United Kingdom. We are stronger because we are united. We are four nations working together. I think COVID had been a really good example of that. Equally, where I do agree with Michelle, and the point one of the DUPs MPs was making just today, and it fits in an article I wrote earlier this week, nobody should be stopped or afraid of having a conversation. It is right will discuss these things, particularly in a centenary year.
