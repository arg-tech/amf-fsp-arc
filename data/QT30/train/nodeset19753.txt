Fiona Bruce [00:11:00] You’re the man in charge. How quickly can Rachel get her vaccine? 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:11:06] You will see this week more social care staff are getting vaccinated. So we get through Category 1 and 2, then move to 3 and 4. By mid-February I guarantee you everybody will have been offered a vaccine and who should, I hope, take up the offer and be vaccinated. 
Rachel Clarke [00:11:26] There are 30,000 patients with COVID in our hospitals right now. So mid February is a long time to wait. 
Fiona Bruce [00:11:34] Andrea. 
[Andrea]: I would like to ask what the opinion is. The BMJ stated that there were concerns from GPs back as far as middle of December with them having been told to expect the vaccine, make plans, arrange patient appointments, then the vaccines didn’t turn up. 
Fiona Bruce [00:11:54] PS, you’re a surgeon. 
Audience Member [00:12:02] Rachel is right. As frontline workers are exposed to this. She mentioned that 650 people, healthcare workers have died as a result of COVID but a lot of those healthcare workers are from the BME community and there has been no mention of the increased risk of COVID in the BME community with this vaccine roll-out. We’re not featured at all on the prioritisation schedules, and I really want to know why that is.
