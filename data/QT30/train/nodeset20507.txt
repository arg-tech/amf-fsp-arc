Fiona Bruce [0:29:16] If it was their choice not because they were ineligible for a vaccine but because they chose not to have it, you would find that ethically unacceptable?
Audience Member 9 [0:29:26] Yes. You can't coerce people to have treatments they don't want. Whether it is for public good or not, it is coercion. It's unfair.
Fiona Bruce [0:29:34] Becky?
Audience Member 10 [0:29:34] So just to completely agree with that. I think it would be immoral to force people to be vaccinated when they don't want to be. I also work in healthcare. I've had my vaccine and I would strongly encourage every single person who gets the letter to go have the vaccine, but there's something about understanding the reasons why people aren't having the vaccine and encouraging, supporting and educating as opposed to penalising people. I agree it would deepen inequality where you have a two-tier system. Also, on a practical basis, the viability of it. You know, how would it work? I just -- I see that it might be open to abuse and exploitation. I just don't think the investment of a system like that is worth what we would get off the back of it. I think it would lead to inequality.
