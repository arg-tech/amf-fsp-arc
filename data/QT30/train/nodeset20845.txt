Andrew RT Davies[00:11:47] It's not a secret about the risks for international travel, and those companies know that. Fiona Bruce[00:11:51] Let me come to Adam, we haven't heard from you. Adam Price[00:11:53] Yes, I think Jamie's broader point though is absolutely correct, because I think that, you know, it's about getting the balance right and I realise every government in the world faces this difficulty of aligning the different priorities but I think business need notice. I think most businesses would accept, look, they're not expecting reopening tomorrow or a date in June even for the removal of all restrictions, but they do need some notice, and I think the Welsh Government is not getting the balance right at the moment in terms of providing some sense of a direction of travel, the criteria that would be central to the decisions and some sense of what's going to happen in April and May.
