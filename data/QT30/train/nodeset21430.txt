[JENNI MURRAY] : I have to say I was somewhat baffled when a real expert in education, Kevin Collins, was asked to be the author to show how we could get this serious situation up and running again. He came up with what I presume was a terrific plan because he really knew what he was talking about, needed Â£15 billion, a lot of money, admittedly, but it was a long-term plan for kids who really, really need help. You know, there are going to be young people leaving school very shortly who have had hardly any education for their final years, which is really worrying.
