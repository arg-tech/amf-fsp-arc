Fiona Bruce[00:21:10] Lots of hands up. Let's hear from some of you in our audience. Will.

Will Unknown[00:21:15] Yeah. Six days before the variant became a concern, I mean, that's just absolute nonsense. Coronavirus is a concern full stop. Who cares if it was a different variant? It should just not have happened, right? We've got such close ties with India that we were always going to get a surge if we didn't put them on the red list.

Fiona Bruce[00:21:37] Chris.

Chris Unknown[00:21:40] Well, Nadhim, hopefully you'll remember me from 6 January episode. I shared a very personal story about this lady next to me, my mum who passed away from COVID. We're not learning. We're not learning. How many months on are we now? We're really not learning. This country, we have the ability, or we had the ability, should I sayâ€¦ It's already here. All the variants are here. The variants are affecting people, and it's here. There will be more variants that are coming. We had the opportunity to make the right decisions back then, six days before saying the Indian variant was a variant of concern. How many more lives are going to be lost to this because of these decisions that are being made? We are just going to keep going full circle. More people are going to lose their loved ones. I've already lost my mum, I don't want to lose anybody else and I don't want any of you to lose anybody else because of the bad decisions being made. Close the borders. Get this country vaccinated, and then let's recover. We have a brilliant country. Let's promote those staycations and let's keep ourselves safe. Thank you.
