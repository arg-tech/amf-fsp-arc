Fiona Bruce[0:36:38] Big sighs from Danny.Danny Sriskandarajah[0:36:42] Last week, 100 odd world leaders wrote to several governments to say the single biggest difference can be made by allowing the manufacturers, and many places are for the producing Covid vaccines because they don't have access to the rights. It's the single biggest thing to do to create a people's vaccine and make the biggest difference in terms of protecting all of us immediately?Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:37:04] I think the production continues to grow and this issue, and I thinkFiona Bruce[0:37:08] OK.Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:37:10] We need to make sure that we have, and we are seeing and it's so tragic, in India, the breakdown of the health service by being overwhelmed by Covid is something we need to help them with so vaccines can deliver for their people.AudienceMember 20210916QT17[0:37:24] If we are talking about sending vaccines abroad then why do people keep on mentioning in the UK vaccinating 12-year-olds now, when surely it would be more helpful to send vaccines over to the most vulnerable in other countries, and then they would benefit everybody?Fiona Bruce[0:37:44] We are not vaccinating 12-year-olds now, the tests are being done to see if that would be done in the future.
