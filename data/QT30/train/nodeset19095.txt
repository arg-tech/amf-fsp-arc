Kate Forbes [00:41:52] The two points I would make is small grants of 500 pound is no replacement for the furlough scheme. Point number 2 is that 700 million pound, that does not just cover business support. That’s for health, transport, and a whole host of other things. The third point is the business support we put in place is more generous than the UK government support. 

Kate Forbes [00:42:16] At the moment in the rest of the UK if you’re obliged by law to close you’ll get a grant. But all the businesses in the supply chain won’t get funding, the businesses impacted won’t get funding. In Scotland we provided funding for those required to close, but also in the supply chain. I think that’s the breadth of support that we need to see. But let’s not kid ourselves, 1,500 pounds of grant, as important as it is, is no replacement for the furlough scheme
