Minette Batters[0:39:20] All these unskilled jobs. We will never have a machine that will make a bed in a hotel. Are you classing that as unskilled?
Nadhim Zahawi[0:39:28] No.
Minette Batters[0:39:30] Are you classing people who pick strawberries and broccoli as unskilled? How do you get more skilled than picking a strawberry. They are skilled jobs and they are important jobs. The care sector is important.
Nadhim Zahawi[0:39:42] Can I answer something...

Minette Batters[0:40:42] It wasn't cheap labour. You're paying seasonal workers Â£15 an hour at the moment.
Nadhim Zahawi[0:40:48] At the moment.
Fiona Bruce[0:40:50] I'm going to move on. Well done Wheelmore. You had a big shout-out on Question Time. This has been your night! Okay. That's enough about Wheelmore! Let's take a question from Ian.
