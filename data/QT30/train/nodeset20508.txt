Fiona Bruce [0:41:26] Bethany?Audience Member 14[0:41:30] I think that we should be ashamed to have Matt Hancock as a health secretary. I think he has been repeatedly disrespectful to everyone in the health and care sector. Colleagues have died, been unwell, because of shortages. Whether people tried to access PPE or not is not the point but the fact there was a shortage and he has ignored that and been disrespectful to a whole sector that he is in charge of is disgraceful.
Fiona Bruce[0:41:56] Becky, you work in the NHS as well.
Audience Member 15[0:41:58] Yes. I think this just speaks to a broader point as not being able to acknowledge when mistakes have been made. I think that Matt Hancock could really learn from the health and care sector. We have systems of learning and safety cultures embedded that we're constantly trying to improve. We're trying to acknowledge when mistakes have been made and learn from them. We are all fallible, we are human beings. We will make mistakes. It was difficult for every single country. By not acknowledging that -- I understand it is politically difficult to say I made a mistake, but we're going to have to start doing that because that's the only way we will get better as a country.
