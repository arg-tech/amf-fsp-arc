Steve Parish[00:50:00] And all of the people that were involved in the protests, you know, from the privileged side of the debate, if you like, can all make a difference. They all run companies, they own companies, they can give opportunities, whether it’s work experience, internships, to help people along the road on the journey. And we can start making a difference now, we can all individually start making a difference tomorrow, and we know we can. And we don’t need to wait for a government review to do it. The government review may help, it may come up with things that we can do with the police and to change attitudes.I certainly think, having looked at this whole issue of history and statues, that we need to review some things. You know, I think if we wouldn’t put a statue up of that person now, why would we continue to have it? You know, do we want a statue to a man who brought 90,000 slaves into the country and killed 19,000 of them? You know, not for me; whilst I think that there are people like Churchill who, although misguided in some beliefs at the time, overall were a force for good.So, I’d like to see real change, I’d like to see us grasp the moment that we’ve got and have some kind of way that we bring about more equality, certainly in the work place.
