Fiona Bruce[00:35:23] Vaughan, Scotland's rather outmanoeuvred you, hasn't it? I mean, it's been very hard for you to say…I know you might be worth four per cent in Scotland but you're not worth four per cent in Wales? 
Vaughan Gething[00:35:31] No, I don't think so, and actually this isn't about manoeuvring, that's the problem. If people's pay is just a manoeuvre, that's the wrong lens to look at it. 
Fiona Bruce[00:35:38] What, you think there's not an element of politics in it? 
Vaughan Gething[00:35:41] Well, there's always politics and lots of choices, but that isn't the way we're approaching pay and I actually do think that our frontline health and care workers are a special case. I've already decided to give for basic rate taxpayers a £500 special payment across health and social care, and the reason they're different is they have put themselves in harm's way for us.
Fiona Bruce[00:36:00] But what about a four per cent pay rise?
Vaughan Gething[00:36:01] They have put themselves in that position, that's why I've made that choice. I've also made clear that we're going to wait for the pay review body recommendations, I made really clear that I'm not setting an arbitrary cap.
