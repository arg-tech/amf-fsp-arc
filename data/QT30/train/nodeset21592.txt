AudienceMember 20210624QT20[0:31:30] So let's not get political about this. Let's not start throwing stones at each other. Let's understand that this is new, this is constantly changing. You know, vaccines -- we've all got used to the fact that we're learning about the vaccine. We seem to think that just because we're fed up with COVID it has to go away now. That's not the case. We don't have to sacrifice grandma, we also don't have to lock grandma in the cellar and never let her see the light of day again. What we have to do is support people who can't work, make sure that companies who took money to support a furlough scheme used that money, if they then did some -- whatever, went bankrupt, that that money was then given back to the government. Some of the large corporations, my understanding is had some interesting ways of dealing with governmental funding. We need to get a grip of it. It is not -- it is just not going to go away. Just because we're bored, you can't just say, right, that's it.
Fiona Bruce[0:32:34] Let's take another question from Andrea.
AudienceMember 20210624QT21[0:32:38] Can we trust the Met Police after an independent panel found them guilty of institutional corruption following the unresolved murder of Andrew Morgan?
Fiona Bruce[0:32:52] Let me remind everyone, Daniel Margen was a private detective, found murdered in a car park in south London, there have been five inquiries, a collapsed trial, no one has been convicted. Then there has been the government commissioned report, as you say, which has talked about institutional corruption within the Metropolitan Police.
