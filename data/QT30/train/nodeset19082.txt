Audience Speaker [00:19:36] I feel as a young person it is easy for me to answer this question. Nicola Sturgeon wasn’t the one who had a chief adviser break the rules and not be criticised from. From that perspective I think it is Boris Johnson’s whole approach to the pandemic. 
Audience Speaker [00:20:00] Douglas says that nobody can point to any difference. I think he is missing the point, that this is about leadership, it is not about numbers. Looking simply at the numbers, disregards the fact if you don’t have people with you, regardless of how hard you lockdown, you’re not going to get people to comply. You’re going to get people to start to believe all kinds of conspiracy theories and end up with non-compliance. So this is about a difference in leadership, hearts and minds. It’s not about a difference in R rates. 
Fiona Bruce [00:20:34] You asked the question. What do you think about what you heard? 
Audience Speaker [00:20:36] I don’t think it was a competition. That wasn’t the reason I asked the question. But I do feel that Nicola Sturgeon has communicated very well. She hasn’t shied away from questions from the press and TV presenters as Boris and his ministers have done. I think she made clear-cut decisions she has explained well. She earned respect from the people. She needs the people on board to follow what she wants them to do. That’s precisely what she’s doing, rather than hiding away like Boris is doing.
