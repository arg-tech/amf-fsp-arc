[0:22:34] I want to come on to the refugees, I want to agree with Rory, about burden-sharing, given that Pakistan and Iran have millions of refugees. Let's remember where the majority have always been - not in the West. Rory made a dig about me not thinking things haven't improved. Of course I'm not denying things haven't improved in many areas over 20 years. I'm saying after 20 years, two trillion dollars and tens of thousands of people dead, clearly haven't improved enough, and the government collapses, politicians like Rory, and all politicians should begin any comment on Afghanistan with an apology first and then an explanation. On refugees, there are ... Afghans waiting to hear about their asylum applications. What will happen to them? I assume they will get leave to remain. Up until Monday morning the Home Office's official guidance said they could be returned to Kabul safely, which I find absurd. That needs to be changed. There are hundreds of "failed" asylum seekers from Afghanistan waiting to be deported to Afghanistan. The Home Office said they're on a pause. Don't pause it. I would like James Cleverly to give an assurance that not a single Afghan will be deported from the UK to any Taliban-run Afghanistan, that ought to be the first premise, the people who are already here and fearing for their lives.
