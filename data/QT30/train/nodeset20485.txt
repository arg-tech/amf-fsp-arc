Grant Shapps[0:03:24] We have had to consult the scientists, ask for the chief medical officer's best advice, ask the experts from SAGE and a group who modelled all of this. It is not like it was all invented from nowhere. They showed us at each stage, if we do these things, this is what we would expect to happen from the response from the virus. I think the British people have been through so much, it has been such a long year, we do not want to blow it now. On 12 April, at the earliest, hopefully it will be then, we can get the outdoor hospitality going, including pubs and venues.

Jeremy King[0:04:06] I think the question is appropriate. We have no clarity. The frustration in the hospitality industry is we don't know where we stand. Just as we were talking about sitting on a park bench outside a pub, why is it I can order a coffee and go to a beauty salon on the 12 April, yet I can't order one in a restaurant on the 17 May? We've proven, the government has admitted, that we're safer than almost any environment.
