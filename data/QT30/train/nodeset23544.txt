[00:20:10] But there's something else that we need that's perhaps even more important than legislation, and that is a cultural change. Police Scotland recently produced a hugely powerful video aimed at men who are… I have a lot of men in my life who I love dearly, my father, my husband, but men need to be in a position to be empowered, to call out other men who are not behaving as they should be behaving.

[00:20:41] I think that there's a wider debate. I think it's important that prevention should be seen rather than a cure and legislation won't solve everything. I think that people need to be aware of what children and what boys are being exposed to on the internet and that what is acceptable and how people should be treated equally and why women have to be fearful of what they're actually…where they're going and if they can go out clubbing. Whereas actually it's the perpetrators and the focus should be on them and on educating them, that this is not acceptable and it will need to change. And that people will stand up and say, no, this isn't just part of society and that girls need to be careful. It's the people who are taking part and doing this that need to be called out.
