Lisa Nandy [00:49:25] It looks like Robert was nodding to all of that, so that was a very good lobbying job that you just did there, Michelle. I guess feel like the Government is trying to solve the wrong problem. In the 2019 election you were more likely to win the jackpot of the national lottery than you were to be convicted of impersonation at the polls. And meanwhile the Government has been sitting for 18 months on the Russia report, which said that the greatest threat to our democratic integrity came from overseas, from foreign interference in our elections. That report made 23 separate recommendations and in 18 months not a single one of those has been implemented. One of them, very, very simple, currently a middle-ranking government department holds responsibility for defending our democracy. The Russia report could not have been clearer that it was given absolutely zero priority within government. They recommended that that should be boosted up to the highest levels with MI5 or someone similar taking over responsibility, 18 months and the Prime Minister has not done a single thing about it. 

I would say to the Government, if you're serious about defending the integrity of our democracy, then instead of making it harder for people here to have an influence over the outcome of our democratic elections, you really should be making it harder for people overseas, including foreign donors, to influence the integrity of our electoral systems.
