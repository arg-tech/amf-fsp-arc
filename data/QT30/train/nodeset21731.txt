Fiona Bruce[0:45:44] Benjamin, would a Labour defeat be a final nail in the coffin for the party? Would it? Would you want Kier Starmer to go?
Benjamin Zephaniah[0:45:58] No, that's a long way off. But I think it would signal -- it would just be kind of representative of the decline, if you like. I think Andy said something interesting about the Labour Party and the left generally not being able to be an effective opposition. This is happening all over the world. Actually, on the right wing as well, the tory party, they are not being good torys I didn't more. They are not one-nation tore Reese any more. They borrow left-wing ideas when they need you are kind of left wing thing where the government steps in and helps people. I doubt if any modern Tory reporters read Adam Smith, or whether any on the left read Karl Marx. I'm probably the only anarchist you have. When you have a good person -- I'm not taking issue with what was just said, but Jeremy Corbyn was really demonised. When you have somebody that comes up and cares about the working class people, he gets demonised in the press. When he's interviewed he's asked about his clothes, ties, glasses, which are not relevant to politics because they want to make him out to be an odd ball character. Funnily enough, I think they really need to find a new way of doing politics.
