Helen Bonnet[0:24:49]Given the global importance of the USA, should people in the UK be concerned that the real choice Americans appear to have is to vote for who they consider is the least worst candidate for the role of President?
Fiona Bruce[0:25:03]Well, Anthony, obviously I’m going to come to you here first. You were Head of Communications for one of those least worst candidates as Helen puts it. What’s your view?
Anthony Scaramucci[0:25:16]Well, it’s the unfortunate by-product of our system. So we get two choices and so some of it is a calibration of exactly what she’s saying. I do agree that there’s a least of the two evils, if you will. But I think this is totally different this time. We have one person that is threatening the system, a 244 year old system known as the American Experiment. We have one person that wants to take polling stations away, remove mail sorting machines, remove post office boxes, and the rhetoric coming from that person is a disaster for the United States. The President of the United States is suggesting that he may or may not accept a peaceful transfer of power. So I’ve called on all patriots of the United States to put aside their partisanship and seek a higher order, which is patriotism, and look at that, and then when you compare that person to the Vice President, he has his shortcomings for sure, but I’m reminded of what Mayor Ed Koch once said about politics, Mayor Koch was campaigning in 1978. He said, well, if you like nine out of the 12 things that I’m saying you should vote for me, but if you like 12 out of the 12 things I’m saying you need a psychiatrist. I think the point being is that there’s no politician that’s perfect in terms of the fingerprint of the voter and the politician. So for me, I want that return to normalcy for the United States. I want it for the world. And so I’ve been a big supporter as a Republican alongside of the Lincoln Project and others here in the United States of the Vice President Joe Biden.
