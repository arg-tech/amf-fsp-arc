Fiona Bruce[0:47:26] Let's take a question from Stephanie pits.
Audience Member 16[0:47:30] Why do the government think that summer schools are a good way for students to catch up? Especially disadvantaged students.
Fiona Bruce[0:47:38] Stephanie, you are a business manager at a secondary school. This is a new announcement about summer schools. Do you think it would be a good idea?
Audience Member 16[0:47:50] I think the problem with it is that certainly for disadvantaged students, they are not going to take up the opportunity. The EEF did a pilot. I think about 50 percent didn't take up the opportunity. I think there are other ways. I think school leaders know their cohorts, their communities, and I think they are best placed to decide how to do the catchup.
Fiona Bruce[0:48:18] You think just leave it up to the schools?
Audience Member 16[0:48:20] Yes. I think they should make the decisions. They know their community, they know their students.
