Audience Member[0:29:20] I think one of the thing that's fueling the desire for Scotland to become independent, despite the fact there are maybe concerns or problems about what that might entail, is how badly the UK government is handling just about everything. That has been mentioned already, some of the comments and things in Westminster are absolutely unhelpful.
Fiona Bruce[0:29:42] Let me say one more thing then I'll come back to you. Kelly.
Audience Member[0:29:46] So we're getting a second chance, if we get the referendum we're getting a second chance to vote for independence. But what if, as Stephen said, it's a lot harder than it turns out -- are we going to get a chance to go back?
Fiona Bruce[0:30:08] Buyer's remorse, if you like. Ian.
Ian Murray[0:30:14] I think the reason they want to turn it into whether or not we have a referendum is because they can't defend their own record in government. The Scottish Parliament requires to deal with 250,000 -- Education system -- to put them into -- this was all before the pandemic. People are worried about their jobs, worried about their -- have all talked about a referendum this year. That's extraordinary.
