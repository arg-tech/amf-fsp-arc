Fiona Bruce[0:39:16] Okay, the man in the back in the white shirt.
AudienceMember 20210930QT28[0:39:10] Two things, one, I look at the different…not the ones on the M25, but before, and I get the impression that the police don't seem to have control of it, whether they're too soft, whether there's not enough of them, they must have the intel to prepare for this. The second thing, if it were me, and I'm not a politician, I'd take one of them HGV lorries where they're sitting, I'd arrest them, put them in that wagon, and send them to the top of Scotland, make their own back and stop them from bleeding doing it, because it just…
Fiona Bruce[0:39:50] I wonder how Scotland would feel about that?
AudienceMember 20210930QT29[0:39:52] Well, it might…but the thing for me is, they're right in what they're doing as in…
Fiona Bruce[0:40:00] In the principle, you think.
AudienceMember 20210930QT30[0:40:01] Yeah, they're right in that, but the way that they're doing it just really making people's days really bad and horrible, and they shouldn't be doing that, because if they want support, they'd better take us with them, and if they don't, they're going to be like they are now. Most of us agree with what they're about, but not the way they're doing it, and they'll lost that support, and then in the end, it'll have been for nothing.
