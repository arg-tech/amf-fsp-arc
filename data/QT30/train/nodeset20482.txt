Fiona Bruce[0:05:50] Tony, as head of the CBI do you agree with Jeremy and with James that it is going too slowly for the hospitality business, which has suffered so much already? .Tony Danker[0:06:06] There are sectors of the economy who are unhappy with the plan. I think the real regret is that you have to wait 10 days for the budget. The budget is part 2 of this plan. It is really important that if we're going to keep those sectors closed, for reasons I completely understand.Fiona Bruce[0:06:22] Do you think it is right to keep them closed so long as the government is suggesting?Tony Danker[0:06:26] I think the prime minister is the one person in the country who has to weigh up medical advice, school requirements, different sectors of the economy. I think it is only right if financial support comes along. By the way, James will know this, but only 40 percent of pubs have outdoor space. I spoke to a pub landlord in Cornwall today saying there's no way I could afford to open my pub so the outdoor is almost irrelevant.
