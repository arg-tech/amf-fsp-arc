Marsha[00:13:22] I’m a parent to year ten and year 12 children and I was wondering whether any consideration is being given to the requests for reducing the curriculum content for the GCSEs and A levels next summer?
Fiona Bruce[00:13:39] Because of all the teaching they’ll’ve missed?
Marsha[00:13:42] Exactly.Fiona 
Bruce[00:13:43] Munira?
Munira Wilson[00:13:45] Well, I think everybody, whether you’re a parent, you’re a teacher, a school governor, everybody is desperate to get children back to school. We know the detrimental impact it’s having on their wellbeing as well as on their educational development, but clearly we’ve got to do that when it’s safe.
Fiona Bruce[00:14:03] And the Lib Dems have put a whole range of suggestions in place that have to happen before children go back to school.
Munira Wilson[00:14:07] That’s right.
Fiona Bruce[00:14:09] So you’re not in any great rush to get them back.
