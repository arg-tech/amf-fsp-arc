[00:19:42] You're asking me four questions at once here, Anas.

Anas Sarwar
[00:19:43]…and you're going to answer about referendums?

Keith Brown
[00:19:44] The point I'm making is, you want to give Boris Johnson…

Anas Sarwar
[00:19:46] Why not focus on what you have the power over?

Keith Brown
[00:19:47]…the power to veto what we have to do in order to prove whether it's spending billions of pounds more on nuclear weapons… 

Anas Sarwar
[00:19:55] And you know this is a pandemic.

Keith Brown
[00:19:53] Whether it's things like the rape clause, you're willing to say, let's put that aside and forget about it? 

Anas Sarwar
[00:19:57] Not at all.

Keith Brown
[00:19:58] I'm not and the SNP's not and we want a better society… 

Anas Sarwar
[00:20:00] But what about cancer here, what about suicides, what about drugs deaths?

Keith Brown
[00:20:00] …than what Boris Johnson does.
