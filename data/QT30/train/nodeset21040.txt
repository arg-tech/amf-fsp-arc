Fiona Bruce[00:44:52] So what will you have to cut to find that £600?
Keith Brown[00:44:54] No. So, what we've said is during the pandemic the UK government have provided the Scottish government with an additional £13.3 billion to deal with the pandemic. We want to use that money, £600 million of it, to give it to the clinicians, rather than the government saying how to spend that, to catch up. But every party is saying we've got to catch up on missed operations, delayed treatments, so how are you paying for it, Keith?
Fiona Bruce[00:45:15] Well, I'll tell you what, we've got a question on…
Keith Brown[00:45:16] How are you paying for it?
