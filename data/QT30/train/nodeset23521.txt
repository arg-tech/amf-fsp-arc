Audience Member 20211028QT01[00:01:26] Thank you, Fiona. In light of UK-wide COVID cases remaining significantly high and deaths consistently averaging over 100 per day, should the governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?

Fiona Bruce[00:01:43] Andrew, more restrictions, should the government impose them, given how infections are rising?

Andrew Bowie[00:01:49] Well, thanks for the question. Obviously the rise of infections is something that is concerning the government. They continue to watch the data and continue to look at the trajectory on which we're headed.
