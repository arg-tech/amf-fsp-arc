Bonnie Greer[0:36:08] What Diane said today that was so powerful -- and we're not talking about it. Because I think the Royal Family and royalty is a deeply embedded subconscious thing in this culture because you always had kings and queens on these isles, always. You like royalty. The question is how does royalty work for you now? That has to be the question. What Diane Abbot said is she has met the Queen, she has met Prince Charles, as have I, and she said they're not racist. But the Royal Family is not just a bunch of people. They are the royal household. They are are the courtier. There's the network around them that keeps them going, props them up, tells them, you go here, you go there. Maybe that needs a clear-out. Maybe that needs a looking into. Because it is just not the Mountbattens Windsors, it's a whole lot of people. Maybe we need to look at that or that needs to be looked at a lot deeper. That's what I would suggest.
