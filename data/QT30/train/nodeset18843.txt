Lisa Nandy[00:05:58] And even on the day that we had that vote in the houses of parliament, that Labour had called and the day that the government decided to U-turn, the Prime Minister was at the dispatch box denying the existence of 600,000 children who’ve been pushed into poverty since 2012 and the fact that that is projected to rise.
Now, this is a result of an approach to government that has systematically stripped support away from children over the last decade, so that now schools in my constituency have to employ workers using the pupil premium to go round to children’s houses, stock their cupboards, put money in the gas or electricity meter, and deal with rats and mice because the parents just simply don’t have enough money to make ends meet. So, when James says, let’s get back to normal, I say, let’s get back to a new normal and build a better country based on better values when we come out the other side of this, because children have been last up to now and they’ve been invisible. Let’s make sure that when we rebuild this country, let’s change that and let’s make sure that they come first.
