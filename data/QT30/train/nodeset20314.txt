Angela Haggerty[0:17:33] You have to excuse me but I don't think a phrase as simplistic as "now is not the time" should overtake parliamentary democracy.
Fiona Bruce[0:17:44] The fact we're in a does that make any difference, do you think?
Angela Haggerty[0:17:48] If they win a majority they have another Parliamentary term for 4 or 5 years. We are hoping by the end of this year that we might be coming out of the crisis stage of the pandemic. Nobody is saying if the SNP won they are going to hold the reserve come the week after. But we have to get back to the point here. This is not about timing. We can have debates about timing and when the best time to do it would be. The point here is about who has the right, who has the authority. Now, if the Scottish people go to the polls and they vote for something quite clearly in an election and then that is denied by Westminster, then they're effectively saying the Scottish Parliament doesn't have, really, any authority. And we're then beyond democracy. This is the part that worries me. If we exhaust the democratic roots and Westminster keeps saying no, the big question then is what happens next.
