Michelle O’Neill[00:56:10] We are having the conversation tonight and the sky isn’t falling in. 	
Arlene Foster[00:56:40] It is important to have the conversation but Michelle will want to place it in a narrative of a united Ireland. I’m placing it in the strengths of the union. The fact is Northern Ireland is not just a European leader, in some sense a world leader in our security sectors in Belfast. We have so much going for us in terms of looking out to the future globally as a result of Brexit. One of the reasons why I supported Brexit was to look globally instead of placing it in the strenghts of the union. the fact is Northern Ireland is not just a European leader, in some sense a world leader in our security sectors in Belfast. We have so much oing for us in terms of looking out to the future globally as a result of Brexit. One of the reasons why I supported Brexit was to look gloablly instea of being restrained by the proximity and inflexibility of the European Union. We need to look globally. I think Norther Ireland is well placed to do that, especially with our young people and the talent we have here in the Northern Ireland with the support of the UK government.
