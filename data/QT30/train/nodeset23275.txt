Fiona Bruce[00:39:02] Okay. We've got another question now from Martin Smith.
Martin Unknown[00:39:06] Can importing beef and lamb 12,000 miles be sustainable, sensible, and a good deal for British farmers?
Fiona Bruce[00:39:18] So you are referring, Martin, I assume to the talk of this UK, Australia trade deal. There are lots of reports about tariff free access for Australia to the UK in terms of sending Australian beef and lamb over to the UK. These are just reports. We don't have any exact details yet. Richard.
Richard Walker[00:39:36] Ultimately, no, I don't think it's particularly sustainable. As a planet we need to be eating less meat and better quality meat, and I think adding onto the huge carbon footprint of meat already by shipping it to the other side of the planet is probably not the smartest thing to do.
Fiona Bruce[00:40:00] I mean, we do already do that of course with New Zealand lamb. Do you think customers will want meat from Australia if it's cheaper, basically?
