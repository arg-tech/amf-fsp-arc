Nigel Owens[00:38:00] But there is no doubt whatsoever that the National Health is a wonderful, wonderful service, and the people who work there are wonderful, wonderful people who have put their own lives at risk in order to save other lives and if that means they are special cases and deserve a four per cent, whatever the percentage is, then of course they should deserve it, you know? Every single one of us pretty much was out on a Thursday night clapping and applauding them. We must never ever forget the great work that they've done. They saved my life 20 years ago and I shall forever be in debt because they go far and beyond what they really need to be doing, and the other people as well in the country we must remember, volunteers even who have given up time in helping others, caring about the neighbours, checking on people, going to get things for people who can't go and get things for themselves, we must not forget the other people as well. But if it means that we put the NHS in a special case, as Claire mentioned, then so be it, because I think they certainly deserve for what they've done for us, every single one of us, and the country, over the last year, and before that as well.
