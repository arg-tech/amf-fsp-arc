Fiona Bruce[0:36:04] I mean, the committee on climate change says you are not on track to meet your net zero target by 2050 and your policies have yet…or your ten point plan is yet to be backed by firm policies.
Grant Shapps[0:36:15] The committee on climate change I think I'm right in saying made that before we set the latest carbon budget, gets very technical, called CB6, which puts us on…if we achieve, of course, will put us on track to do it, but you know, perfectly legitimate for people to protest. We have an open democracy where people should be able to do that, but walking onto a motorway, putting their lives and others and the emergency services at risk, it's completely out of order, and that's why I stepped in to stop it. 
Fiona Bruce[0:36:48] David, will you be comfortable if some of these protestors go to prison?
David Lammy[0:36:51] Yes, because I support the right to protest, absolutely, I don't support the government in some of the changes that they've made to protests, but you have to protest within the law. I think there was a woman who ended up with some paralysis this week because she couldn't get to hospital, and that underlies the problem. So I think the High Court were right in their decision.
