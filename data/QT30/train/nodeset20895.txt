Vaughan Gething[00:47:58] But only generally and actually there have been lots of times in this election where seats will be decided by small margins and we're in an extraordinary period of time, there's been a much greater profile for devolutions through the last year and a bit, and I think a greater awareness of the powers that we have within the Welsh Parliament, the responsibilities we have, and I think, and I certainly hope that more people will cast a ballot in this election because of that, because you can see just how important it is to choose a government here in Wales on our side to make choices because the pandemic isn't over, we then have a huge task to rebuild the country and make it a fairer country for the future. I think everyone of every age, not just 16 and 17, but over 16s and everyone around that as well has a real stake in deciding the future of Wales, and I hope everyone regardless of their view goes out and makes a choice for who will be the next Welsh Government.
