Jeremy King[0:25:06] I do know and understand the concerns about civil liberties when it comes to COVID vaccines, but one of the things I do like about it, it's very egalitarian, the great successes of the vaccine programme is it doesn't matter who you are, how much money you have, whatever, you have a right. And it is one of the purest examples. I would love to see the passports used. I don't want to force anybody to have a vaccine, though.
Fiona Bruce[0:25:36] When it comes to who is having the vaccine, Jeremy, younger people are going to get it much later on so you have the UK Hospitality Association saying it's not workable because young people won't be vaccinated until the autumn so they won't have a certificate to come into a restaurant like yours.Jeremy King[0:25:56] Absolutely. That is always going to be the shortcomings of it. But this is only for a short period. It could be the way through. I'm not advocating as such, I'm not against it.
