Sarah Jones: Everyone is worrying about that. We worry about care homes, of course we do, because we know that, you know, there are logistical issues with this vaccine in terms of the temperature it needs to be. Are we going to make sure we can get to those care homes properly. Then I think there’s a challenge with public health and making sure people know they can trust this vaccine and they should use it. We’re not measles-free in this country any more. We were. We’re not any more because people haven’t trusted the vaccine. So we need a really good public health message. But, you know, this is a really big challenge. The government haven’t got it right on things like test and trace. They have to get it right now because these are people’s lives on the line. We can’t get this wrong again.
