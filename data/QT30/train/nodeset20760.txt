Victor Adebowale[0:46:48] We need to own up to this. I do hope the Queen, as a unifying figure, can give voice to the black community -- and the white community -- and actually talk about how we bring this society together. These issues have been around for a long time and it is time we started to have a conversation about how to resolve them.
Fiona Bruce[0:47:12] I'm going to move on now. From PS.
AudienceMember 20210318QT23[0:47:18] Thank you. Do the panel believe that NHS staff deserve more than a 1 percent pay rise when they've had secure jobs and incomes throughout the pandemic, unlike many other people?
Fiona Bruce[0:47:30] You're a surgeon, aren't you, in the National Health Service? You would be subject to this as well. Do you think that you and your colleagues deserve more than a 1 percent pay rise?
