Slow in the first place to formal quarantining, slow to mandatory testing, slow to hotel quarantining, and slow to put India on the red list.

We've seen chaos in our airports where passengers coming from any of the three categories and mixing together, sometimes it seems hours on end. Secondly, we have this mixed messaging on the amber list.
