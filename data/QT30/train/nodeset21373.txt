Nadhim Zahawi[00:15:54] The evidence of people… Well, let me just address that, Fiona, for a second. The evidence for people coming from Pakistan was that the variant of concern was the so called South African variant. That wasn't the evidence from India, and the positivity of those travellers was higher from Pakistan than it was from India.
Fiona Bruce[00:16:17] So the COVID test positivity was five per cent for travellers from India between 25 March and 7 April. It was six per cent for Pakistan and four per cent for Bangladesh.
Nadhim Zahawi[00:16:25] But I was about to…but there is a variant of concern…
Fiona Bruce[00:16:27] So how does your argument hold water?
Nadhim Zahawi[00:16:30] Because I was explaining to you that the variant of concern out of Pakistan was the so called South African variant. There was no variant of concern. We put India on the red list on 23 April, you can check this…
Fiona Bruce[00:16:39] And it was a month earlier than that that the first mutant variant was detected in India.
