Lorna Slater[00:54:45] So, alleviation of poverty goes a long way to doing those things, you know, good work, fair wages, all these things go a long way to that, and so will the national care service. All of this is part of rebalancing our economy, and I look forward to getting to work on it.Fiona Bruce[00:54:56] Okay. Jude, you asked this question, what do you think of what you've heard?Jude Unknown[00:55:01] Yeah, I would welcome, of course, any solid investment and commitment to community-based rehabilitation services.
