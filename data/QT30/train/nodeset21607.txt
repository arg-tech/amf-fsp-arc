[0:35:02] We have a lot of young officers because a lot of people lost their positions and we are recruiting. We have to make sure they have the resilience and support that they don't get involved in anything like this. The inquiry is something like out of The Line Of Duty. So, is everything okay? No, it isn't. Is the answer to say sack this person? No, I don't think it is. We need a proper response. But it needs to be quite far-ranging and they do need to accept what the findings are.

[0:35:36] So the report Daniel has talked about institutional corruption. It is not the first time the word "institutional" has been used in relation to the Met.

Daniel Finkelstein
[0:35:52] That was rejected and I think time has proven it was correct. In some ways it is all political crisis for me. I can't answer yes to your question completely. I can't answer 100 percent.

Fiona Bruce
[0:36:04] So you can't say yes, I trust the Met Police.

Daniel Finkelstein
[0:36:08] I can't, which for somebody with my politics is very, very difficult. But the nature of this report coming on top of a whole load of other incidents makes it impossible. The response to this report was horrific. If you are being accused on a solid basis of institutional corruption, which was not just withholding help from these inquiries and resisting the inquiry, but also underneath it some quite serious allegations about the conduct itself, which was what was behind it, you know, criminal acts, and to then respond, well, we're not institutionally corrupt, as a sort of flat answer, I just thought that was completely unacceptable as an institution.
