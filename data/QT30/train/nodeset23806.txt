Fiona Bruce[0:11:06] Let's hear the response from Mehdi.
Mehdi Hasan[0:11:08] First of all, the last US soldier died in February 2020. Do you know what happened in February 2020? Donald Trump signed a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, this idea that you could stay in a stalemate Afghans made it easy for us to leave, according to the polls ... of the Afghans wanted them out as of last January. You talk about air operations. 330% increase in civilian casualties from our air attacks between 2017 and 2020. When you were in Afghanistan, Rory, did you go and talk to the families of the people we killed?
Nelufar Hedayat[0:11:42] I do. And I can tell you one thing ...
Fiona Bruce[0:11:44] Rory, just one minute. I need to bring other people in as well.
Nelufar Hedayat[0:11:48] It's important to remember, as we talk as often we do in the West, we lob insults at each other, you did this wrong, United States, you did this wrong, Tories, Labour Party - frankly, from what I'm hearing from my colleagues and family in Afghanistan, we are sick of it. The deadliest year in this battle in Afghanistan was 2019 for the Afghan people. That's the year that most Afghans died. So to act as though, with respect to both of you, as though this is some sort of political game, as we've often heard, as a journalist myself, I've covered these stories, it's a political football that gets kicked from here to there, and the Afghan people pay in blood. [Applause].
