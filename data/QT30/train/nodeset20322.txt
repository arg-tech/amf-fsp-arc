Ian Murray [0:31:07] So, maybe if we're going to turn the May election into a reserve on whether or not we have a referendum we could start asking the big questions to be debated now. The currency issue, how we get back into the EU. Jeane already said very clearly that she thinks Brexit is a material change of circumstances even though it was highlighted in the white paper and David Cameron highlighted before the next referendum. We have to put every single focus into COVID recovery and we're going to have a referendum, set up a new nation in 18 months, that was the proposal before, no access to the EU, the EU border -- no answers about currency. It is 7 years since the last referendum. We don't have these questions in front of us. The oil price was supposed to be $115 a barrel. It has been less than half of that. The entire economy was based on that. The economic proposition is a disaster. Brexit is a disaster. If Brexit taught us anything we should be building bridges, not walls. I'm the only person on this Panel that is consistent here. Because I believe Scotland should be be in the UK and the UK should be in the EU. That's the way you make your economy strong, that's the way you bring people together.
