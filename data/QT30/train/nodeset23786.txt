Fiona Bruce[0:47:22] Sure but the point you are making
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:47:24] The key point is it's a really interesting challenge is that the case that we want to er... say, and our young people say, we would rather as vaccines come off the factory line, they are not here yet, but when they do, that we should send them first through Kofax, and get G AR VI to deliver those. I think that's an interesting challenge.
Daisy Cooper[0:47:50] That was the challenge we put to the Government in February this year! We asked you to think about that process of when and how we could have the parallel roll-out of the vaccine. Here we are almost in May, and that's one of the challenges, and haven't a started thinking about the challenge that's the problem! It's taken months and months
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:48:06] We don't have the vaccines to be able to do something
Jon Ashworth[0:48:08] It's not yet, it's not just
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:48:12] One in one out
Jon Ashworth[0:48:14] A debate about excellent at vaccines in this country, and it's also about what we are doing to invest in primary health care, and some of the poorest parts of the world. At the moment, of the 900 million vaccines that have been distributed worldwide, only 1% of them are in low income countries. Some of that is about access to the vaccine, and the health infrastructure, and you are cutting the aid role.
