Kate Andrews[0:22:06] If we are going to start talking about a two-tiered society where people who have been vaccinated have certain liberties returned, and people who haven't don't, that can't just happen through an update, through the travel secretary, through the Transport Secretary, it can't happen through an update at a press conference. It's got to happen in Parliament. There has to be a proper debate and scrutiny over the idea of a two-tier system. I would also just flag that if you do bring it in, especially in the near future, the people who are going to be left out of that are younger people who have stayed home for months over the past 18 months.
Fiona Bruce[0:22:46] Let's put this to the Government OK. I know they said today that people who have had two jabs, unlike Kate, at some point perhaps you will tell us when, will be told that they can go to amber list countries. What about everybody else? When will we know and what about everybody else?
Robert Buckland[0:23:04] The announcement has come just this evening, the plan will be to announce the details before the 19th of July, so that people can plan ahead, and indeed those organisations responsible for you know, airports etc can also start to plan ahead.
