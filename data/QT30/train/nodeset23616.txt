Fiona Bruce[0:32:40] More of you voted for Brexit than against Brexit. Maybe you're having buyer remorse. The man in the tie.
AudienceMember 20211014QT26[0:32:50] It is about people not wanting to do the jobs on offer in abattoirs. Maybe it is the conditions, but it is a lot of people now don't want to cut up meat, there is a big vegetarian impact that's grown so much. How do we encourage British people into this trade? I don't know how long it takes to train a butcher, but I'm sure there has been no plans for training butchers at all.
Minette Batters[0:33:18] Two years. It can't happen overnight, that's the point.
Fiona Bruce[0:33:22] The man right at the back there.
AudienceMember 20211014QT27[0:33:24] Hi there. There is an irony when we're discussing Brexit. In my opinion, a lot of people voted for Brexit because they didn't want foreign workers coming over here and taking our jobs, and now that's exactly the situation that we've got. We've got a lack of foreign workers which is why we've got these shortages.
Fiona Bruce[0:33:42] Can I just hear from someone - the majority of you voted for Brexit. We selected this audience carefully. I am assuming you didn't vote for Brexit.
AudienceMember 20211014QT28[0:33:52] I did.
Fiona Bruce[0:33:54] And you're still saying that. Rosie?
Rosie Jones[0:33:58] I agree that the question links to the first question and that we are getting these labour shortages and you keep talking about the wage increases, but that means nothing if there is labour shortages so when the food prices rise and it is a case of inflation and the majority of people who will get a wage increase won't feel it because the cost of living will continue to increase.
