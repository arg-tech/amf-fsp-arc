Iona Bain[0:21:46] If I could jump in here because I think Stephen is absolutely correct to say that young people's jobs right now need to be right at the top of the priority list. 
Because we know that young people are the most likely to have been furloughed, to have had their wages and hours cut as a result of this crisis, and to have lost their jobs altogether, and they are also the most likely to be working in the industries that have been hardest hit by lockdown, like retail, tourism and hospitality, and there are predictions that there could be youth unemployment rising by 600,000 this year because people who are leaving education this year are coming into a really tough jobs market, the toughest that we have ever seen. 
So we need specific measures, and I have to say, listening to Steve there, I'm surprised he didn't mention more about apprenticeships and the apprenticeship levy, and the fact that it has not been a success. 
Since it was introduced in 2017, it was meant to get more young people, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds, into apprenticeships to give them better life chances.
What we have seen is that participation rates among those from more disadvantaged backgrounds has fallen by a third.
