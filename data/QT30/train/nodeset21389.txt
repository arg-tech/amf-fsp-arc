Harriet Green[00:29:40] I think there are two things from my perspective. One isn't gimmicky and the other one worries me. The first on one level of accountability, so the timeliness of the trains, the cleanliness, the schedule. There's a single point of responsibility and accountability. I think that makes sense, and listening to the inputs that have been received, that's good. What worries me is that with that single point of contact is this then the innovation that has had more people on trains than in any other time in the last century with the innovation, the creativity, will that all be lost because ministers, because government, because Whitehall run the trains? So I think…Fiona Bruce[00:30:15] So you're seeing that potentially as the dead hand of the state are you?Harriet Green[00:30:18] Yeah. Fiona Bruce[00:30:19] Okay. Nick, clearly that's not your view inasmuch as the more state involvement the better as far as you're concerned.Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:30:25] Well, no, that isn't my view. But I am concerned about the gap that exists between…Fiona Bruce[00:30:30] So what is Labour's policy then?Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:30:31] I'll come to that. I believe in a publically owned railway, and I'll come to that in a moment.Fiona Bruce[00:30:35] Yes. Exactly.
