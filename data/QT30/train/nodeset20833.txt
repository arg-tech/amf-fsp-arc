Claire Fox[00:04:00] I'm sure a lot of people will be frightened to travel but I do think that people should be able to weigh up risks. I also haven't liked a certain tone which is this idea that anyone who goes on holiday is just being selfish and indulgent and that somehow that's a degenerate thing to do when in fact people do need to exert their freedom at this point. There have been terrible stories and people need the opportunity to relax and I do think holidays are part of that. So I'm hoping that I will get to be able to travel.
