AudienceMember 20211014QT17[0:16:16] At the moment the cost of living is rocketing. I work in a local supermarket and I have seen with my own eyes the fact that the shelves are emptying, people are saying, I only had somebody saying to me, she bought an item she buys regularly, gosh, it has gone up 10p, from 50p to 60p. The reality is the people who are at the most disadvantaged are going to be dreadfully badly hit and we have had enough of seeing in this country people going to foodbanks and people living on the streets and people unable to afford rent and yet we're still determined to make life even harder for the people who already have it hard.

AudienceMember 20211014QT18[0:17:04] Yesterday the Prime Minister's speech, I think people were hoping for some substance and all they got was jokes. I'm sorry, but that's offensive. I work in an infants school and we work hard. Our children have been a complete privilege to work with throughout the Covid pandemic and we need help. We need help. We don't want to hear jokes. We want some action. We want some support. Our children deserve better. And to make jokes about things, there are serious things to talk about. There are serious things to do. Start acting. Stop joking. (APPLAUSE). [ DONE]
