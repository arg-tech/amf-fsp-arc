Fiona Bruce[0:32:12] Let's move on. I want to take another question.
AudienceMember 20210902QT27[0:32:16] (22). Thank you. With high casualties, both civilian and military, millions of people displace, trillions spent in no post-invasion stability, what was the war in Afghanistan actually for? [Applause].
Fiona Bruce[0:32:34] Mehdi, I want to come to you first on this one. What was the war for?
Mehdi Hasan[0:32:40] I mean, I wasn't in favour, I definitely haven't been in favour of it over the last 20 years. I'm probably the wrong person to ask. I don't know what it was for. I know what we were told it was for. We were told that Afghanistan was the good war, Iraq was the bad war. Some of us were opposed to it from the very beginning. We thought it would be a Vietnam-style quagmire, tens of thousands of civilian casualties, thought the terror threat would go up and not down. I wish - I wish - we could have been wrong about all that. Sadly, those of us who warned about those things turned out to be right. We are in that position now where 20 years later we are wondering, was it worth it? What was it for? We know the metrics set down, some were met, some not met. Bin Laden was killed, ten years after we innovated in a whole other country. We were told the Taliban was toppled, yes, it was. But guess who is in charge of Afghanistan today, even more powerful and involved than before?
