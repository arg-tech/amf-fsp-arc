[00:41:11] Harriet, is it a good deal? Is it sensible, is it sustainable, and could it offer a template for future deals?

Harriet Green
[00:41:16] Well, I don't think we know enough about the actual detail of this deal. But if you think we are no longer in the same position we were in the largest single market in the world in Europe, and so there is a requirement for government to be out negotiating trade deals. We already do close to 40 billion a year with Australia, we're their fifth largest trading partner, and I think other deals will need to be sought if we are to…not necessarily for beef. In fact, I spoke this morning to Australian colleagues and asked about this and they said, we haven't heard anything about this deal, no one here is talking about it. 

Fiona Bruce
[00:41:58] Well, some of them are, because they've been on the airwaves in the UK from Australia. But, anyway…

Harriet Green
[00:42:01] But the actual radio and TV… Because the question I asked was, what will you be getting from us? If we're supposedly getting your beef, what will you be getting from us, and no one seemed to know. So I do think trade deals and finding ways to create markets, the pan transpacific market that was being developed, I think you will see more of that, but I think consumers will make choice based on what's right for them, about sustainable eating locally, but trading partners with New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, these will become very much more important when the market we were in has inexorably changed, and it was the largest in the world.
