Liz Saville-Roberts [00:44:00] Over and above that, representing a highly rural area, which of course is served by Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, and Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board has been in special measures for five years, what I get people concerned about with me, is that they just can’t get the results from their tests back again. So, I’m sad to say that we have these high stories, but when it comes down to people’s experience on the ground, and that critical way that we need to be getting people’s confidence back, they need to see the tests working, that’s the only way that’s going to unlock people’s confidence and then unlock our economy.Vaughan Gething [00:45:06] Well, there’s some facts to deal with there, if I may? When it comes to test results in Wales, over 90 per cent of the people get their test results within 48 hours. The idea that it’s somehow a widespread problem with late test results, simply doesn’t match the facts. When it comes to our testing capacity, the review that I ordered into where we were, revealed that we couldn’t meet those early aspirations about the number of tests we wanted, because equipment was delayed in other countries, some countries stopped the export of testing equipment.
