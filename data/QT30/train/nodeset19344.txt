Fiona Bruce [00:47:42] You are passionate of the media. [DONE]

Liam Halligan [00:47:46] I’m a freelance journalist. This was cobbled together quickly as Britain was entering in 1973 and for the cost of a lunch with George Pompidou, Edward Heath at the last-minute said you can enter our fishing waters. Now we get to a situation where two-thirds of fish in British waters are caught by non-British boats. That can’t be right. This is a kind of Colonial relationship where some independent countries have a hold over the sources of another now sovereign, independent country. And the reason fishing is such a small percentage of our economy is because it has been decimated. It’s been decimated in some of the poorest areas of the country. 
Fiona Bruce [00:48:34] Over 50 percent of the fishing quota has been sold to foreign companies. 
 Liam Halligan [00:48:40] Because our industry can’t get an economic foothold because it has been so marginalised. By the way, lots of my friend in the Green Party, for many years were against the fishing policy because it has led to over fishing. If we had a British fishing policy we could allow stocks to replenish in our British waters. Why can’t we have the same deal the Norwegians have. That’s why they didn’t join the economic community as well in 1937, where they renegotiate, every year, fair and square.[DONE]
