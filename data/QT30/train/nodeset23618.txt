Rosie Jones[0:58:50] Because they needed to do more. I feel like when we got a government where Dominic Raab doesn't know who -- is and I'm a woman, but also as a disabled woman, I don't feel safe at night. I don't feel safe with police officers. We need to get to a place where women, but also any minority, if you're a woman, if you're disabled, if you're in the LGBT spectrum, if you're a person of colour, the fact is right now in the UK, they don't feel safe at home at night and that is a scary place to live in.
Fiona Bruce[1:00:26] Rosie, thank you. Right, so still a few hands up. Forgive me, you in the front. Our hour is up. I'm going to have to end it here.
