[0:50:24] OK Danny?

[0:50:28] Look, I feel for you, and my uncle is in ICU at the moment and the only time we can see him is when the nurse takes a FaceTime Zoom call that we have with him. This is awful. But I think, I generally trust our carers, our health system to try to judge that you know, the clinical needs and the risks with the patient care, and the family interests. I know it's difficult, and I think we have to trust that they are making the decisions in the best interests of people in their care. Tim?

Tim Stanley
[0:50:56] I think we have to listen to people who are in care, and ask them precisely what it is they want.

Tim Stanley
[0:51:04] There's a balance to be struck between protecting people against the danger of the virus, but also between avoiding making people's lives so miserable trapping them indoors all day denying them contact with people that their life becomes not worth living. A terrible thing to say but that's how some people have expressed it.
