Munira Wilson[00:40:36] I don’t think saying that…Jed Mercurio[00:40:37] But moving forward means learning from your mistakes and being honest. And unfortunately, there’s that gap between the learning behaviour and the transmission of the information about what has been learned and where mistakes were made. And I think that that is problematic for people to have confidence about the information they receive and how they go forward.Fiona Bruce[00:40:57] Okay, I’m going to move on because we’ve got another question on a different topic, which I want to get in, from Laura Hill.Laura Hill[00:41:04] Earlier this week, the Prime Minister announced a review into racial inequality in the country. Isn’t it time for action rather than just another review?Fiona Bruce[00:41:15] Munira?Munira Wilson[00:41:16] Absolutely, and it was unfortunate that the announcement was buried in a piece about Winston Churchill’s statue. People are angry, people are hurting. That’s why despite the fact that we’ve got a public health emergency and nobody wants to see crowds out on the street, people feel moved to go out and protest, having been outraged by what they’ve seen happen in the US with George Floyd, but also with the huge inequalities that have been exposed by the virus, and we’ve seen the BAME community disproportionately affected.
