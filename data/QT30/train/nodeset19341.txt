Fiona Bruce [00:42:34] Can I ask you because our political editor Laura Kuenssberg is reporting that the negotiations are going less well and the EU is throwing in a few new added things to be discussed. What light can you shed on that?[DONE] 

Michelle Donelan [00:42:48] As you will know Laura’s not in the negotiations, neither am I. 

Fiona Bruce [00:42:52] I was just wondering if -- what you can tell us about that. 

Michelle Donelan [00:42:56] We’ll find out over the coming days exactly what’s happening. We have been very clear throughout this, whether we get a deal or not we’re going to make a success of this. I don be it is helpful talking all the time about the withdrawal agreement -- 

Fiona Bruce [00:43:12] That’s not a trade deal. 

Michelle Donelan [00:43:14] I think we’re always harking back to where we were a while ago. This no deal rhetoric, really.[DONE]
