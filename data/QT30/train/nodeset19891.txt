Fiona Bruce [00:03:28] You are critical about the protocol but you did describe the renegotiated protocol as a serious and sensible way forward. 
Arlene Foster [00:03:38] No. I don’t think I did. What I said was -- that was back in objecting when we were saying in 2019 that it was important that the Northern Ireland assembly had a say in those matters. Of course he decided not to those matters and it was just around SPS and animal checks at that time. What we have at the moment is a who will range of protocol actions causes damage to Northern Ireland and, of course, which is not what we were talking about in October 2019. 
Fiona Bruce [00:04:08] Anand, teething problems or deeper issues with the protocol? 
Anand Menon [00:04:14] It is a combination of things. Partly teething problems. Some of the problems we are having will be overcome. It is a question of traders learning how to use the forms, fill them in, but there are other factors that come into play. At the moment we have a series of grace peers for food imports into Northern Ireland Northern Ireland. That ends on 1 April. It will get harder again, more delay at the borders. At the moment we are dealing with a period of much reduced trade and travel because of COVID. So the real test of this agreement is going to come when we come out the other side of the pandemic, trade which travel come back to closer to their normal level, at which point it is only then we’ll be able to judge. But we shouldn’t expect things to be the same as before 31 December. What Brexit means is there are checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that is going to mean cases it might mean shortages.
