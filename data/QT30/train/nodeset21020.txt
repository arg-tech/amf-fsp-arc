Fiona Bruce[00:29:35] Jo?
Jo Unknown[00:29:39] Yes, I just echo that. I think that this transition from oil and gas is inevitable so why are we not looking at retraining and upskilling people into renewables now rather than waiting for the inevitable to happen?
Fiona Bruce[00:29:55] Ruth?
Ruth Unknown[00:29:55] Yeah, absolutely. What I do see is that there is a gradual training, which is a damn sight more than the Tories did when the pits closed. I saw precious little training going on for the thousands of miners who just got put out and hung out to dry, you know, I didn't see any Tories screaming about that.
Douglas Ross[00:30:15] Wellâ€¦
Fiona Bruce[00:30:15] I'll come back to you a minute, Doug, but let me just get round the rest of the panel. So, Labour's plans in terms of phasing out oil and gas, you've made no particular pledges on that?
Anas Sarwar[00:30:23] Well, look, we can only truly talk about a just transition if it takes communities with us, and if we decimate tens of thousands of jobs without a genuine transition to renewable jobs that's not going to be a fair transition or a just transition.
