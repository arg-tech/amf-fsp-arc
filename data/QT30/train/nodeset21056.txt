Fiona Bruce[00:50:58] And on investment, Anas, you're pledging to spend even less than the SNP.

Anas Sarwar[00:51:01] No, not at all.

Fiona Bruce[00:51:03] In the first year?

Anas Sarwar[00:51:04] No, not at all. So, what we're saying is…

Fiona Bruce[00:51:05] Three hundred and fifty million versus 500 million?

Anas Sarwar[00:51:07] You know, so what we need is rapid diagnosis centres, but we're not going to build the physical buildings and those rapid diagnosis centres in the time of weeks or months – so let's get temporary facilities up and running right now, so we can start that one.

Fiona Bruce[00:51:18] But just to be clear, in the first year, are you saying you're pledging to spend as much as the SNP on the NHS?

Anas Sarwar[00:51:22] So, what we're saying is there's much more longer-term capital investment.
