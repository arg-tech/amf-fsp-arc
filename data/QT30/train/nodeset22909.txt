FIONA BRUCE [00:50:12] Lots of different points there. I’m going to drag us back to the original question which came from Andy about confidence about getting the vaccine through post the end of December. We hear all sorts of warnings from road hauliers about not being ready, about holdups at Customs, lorry parks, all the rest of it. Are you confident that that’s not going to be a problem? 

MATT HANCOCK [00:50:44] We have a plan for the vaccine that is being manufactured in Belgium. If necessary we can fly it. 

FIONA BRUCE [00:50:50] That is a lot more expensive than coming through a lorry. 

MATT HANCOCK [00:50:56] The importance of the vaccine can’t be underestimated so we have to plan for all events. Many of the points made some of the points about some of the challenges, like Joe’s point about the fact the vaccine needs PPE, absolutely, that’s a critical part of the plan. So it underlines how this is a hugely complex project but it is one that we’ve we’ve been preparing for for some time. 

FIONA BRUCE [00:51:22] You’re confident that Brexit, if we do leave the European Union without a deal, is not going to hold up the delivery of the vaccine to this condition? 

MATT HANCOCK [00:51:32] I am confident in that. We have a plan, yes.
