Lisa Nandy[00:51:25] You've chosen not to do one and you've chosen to do the other, so you've made that choice.
Robert Buckland[00:51:27] Well, I disagree with your…with respect, Lisa, I disagree with your analysis here, that I think it's incumbent upon the Government to do it can on all fronts, which I can assure we are doing. I want to protect this democracy, as does the Prime Minister, and we certainly have benefited, frankly, from increased voter turnout. If you see the last couple of elections where voter turnout has gone up, then it is the Conservatives who have won. So let's not buy into this false argument about voter suppression.
Lisa Nandy[00:51:54] But you've had 18 months to implement…you accepted the Russia report, you accepted that this was the greatest threat to our democratic integrity, you've had 18 months. The Prime Minister sat on that report, he tried to suppress it, he wouldn't allow it to be published, he blocked its publication in Parliament, then he said he accepted it and still we've seen no action. Why are you so intent on stopping people here having an impact on our electoral system, but not on stopping people overseas from doing so?
Robert Buckland[00:52:29] I'm sorry, I don't agree with your analysis, with respect.
