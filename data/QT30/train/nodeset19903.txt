Fiona Bruce [00:46:02] So you welcome the conversation about a united Ireland. Brandon Lewis [00:46:06] I fully respect everybody -- part of the point of having peace and what has been delivered through the Good Friday Agreement is we can have these debates in a proper way. Fiona Bruce [00:46:14] But not a referendum. Brandon Lewis [00:46:16] I might entirely disagree with Michelle. I will make the case why Northern Ireland doesn’t just benefit from the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom benefits from Northern Ireland being part of it. As I say, we’re in the cent triyear. It is a chance to promote what Northern Ireland has to offer around the world. Fiona Bruce [00:46:36] Lessly. What would you like to say? Audience Member [00:46:40] I would like to make the point regarding the discussion about a united Ireland or not, as the case may be. Can I ask Arlene and Michelle, if those discussions don’t go well, are you going to argue the point out and then throw your teddy I didn’t say out the pram again in another three years? Fiona Bruce [00:47:08] I heard you say if they don’t reach agreement will they throw their Ted I didn’t say out the programme because people are I’ll come back to that in a mint. James.
