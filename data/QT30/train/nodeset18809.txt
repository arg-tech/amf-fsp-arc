Fiona Bruce[0:40:10] Iona?Iona Bain[0:40:12] Well, the housing crisis in the UK is extraordinarily complicated. As Jess said, it's one that we have had for decades, successive governments really failed to tackle comprehensively. When you look at the specific case of Robert Genrik, I don't want to comment on the details of the case, but what I do want to say is that, in this country, the new-build housing industry needs to be held to account for building homes that are overpriced to shoddy standards and, in the last week, we have seen a young couple in less centre banner from the front of their house saying buying this decision we ever made. Come and ask us why. And obviously their developer wasn't particularly happy about that, tried to have it stopped. But that was their experience and unfortunately it's all too common. have is radical reform. To be fair we hear a lot of are going to kick the planning laws into touch, which is exactly what we need. We need to have reform of land values. So, when developers buy up land, they owning that land. None of it is shared with the what we need is to share those profits with the community so that they can be invested pack into the social and affordable housing and local infrastructure. To be fair, the community infrastructure levy was supposed to do that. However, all too often it tends to be negotiated away by powerful developers and councils cave in because they just want to get more houses built in the local area come what may. So that's not been working and I think that's been around longer than the current conservative generation of politicians.
