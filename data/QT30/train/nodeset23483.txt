Paul Polman[0:31:38] At the time of COVID, 20 percent of the world had agreed to be net 0 by 2050. We now have 80 percent of the world. China, India, Russia have signed up to the 1.5 degree pledge. They are participating in the 100 million financing for emerging markets. They have signed major declarations on forest reduction and forest restoration. So all these --
Fiona Bruce[0:32:06] Paul, I'm sorry to interrupt. Let me ask you about deforestation. You have 110 countries agreeing to reverse it by 2030, then today, Indonesia, who had signed up to that, said hang on a minute, we don't want to be doing that after all. That must be disheartening, to say the least.
Paul Polman[0:32:28] India has made a commitment to be net zero by 2070 and on carbon emission by 2050. Russia has made a commitment with China to be net zero by 2060. These countries are there. They have made commitments and there are mechanics that increasingly are put in place to hold everybody accountable. This is the next step that needs to happen. So we can all speculate on the future of whether or not these countries are doing but, as I said, they are the most affected by climate change. They have the most interest to ensure the right actions will be implemented.
