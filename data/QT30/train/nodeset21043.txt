Douglas Ross[00:41:51] No, it's a great point, Shelly. That's why we want to build 60,000 new social homes in the next parliament, the most ambitious social housing project since devolution.
Willie Rennie [00:42:00] And cut universal credit [voices overlap 41:59].
Douglas Ross[00:42:00] That's why we want to roll out full fibre broadband by 2027, because one of the biggest things that we've seen during this pandemic is people not being connected with friends and loved ones. Why are we still in 2021 struggling with good Wi-Fi signals in many parts of Scotland? That's the type of investment that can connect people and communities all over again.
Willie Rennie[00:42:18] But, Douglas, why do you think it's a priority to give you and me and Anas and Keith and Lorna a tax cut, why do you think that's a priority?
Douglas Ross[00:42:27] Well, I am happy not to accept that… 
Willie Rennie[00:42:29] Oh come on.
Douglas Ross[00:42:30] …but I would like to give it to 1.1 million people in Scotland.
Willie Rennie[00:42:33] Oh come on. You're obviously embarrassed about it and that's why you're not going to accept it.
