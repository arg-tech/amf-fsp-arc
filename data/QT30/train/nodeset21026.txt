Keith Brown[00:26:40] So, there are things we can do to address the effects of taking those hydrocarbons out of the ground but eventually we'll have to stop. Lorna's right, climate change is an existential threat to the planet – we have to deal with this. 
Fiona Bruce[00:26:52] So when do you think…?
Keith Brown[00:26:52] We should not be doing it at the expense of people that are currently in that industry and, whatever we do, we have to look after the families and the people involved there.
Fiona Bruce[00:26:58] Well, do you want to give us a timeframe, Keith, give us your plan?
Keith Brown[00:26:59] Well, I can't say specifically when it's going to stop, it will depend on the supply that's there just now of course. 
Lorna Slater[00:27:04] So, there you see one of the massive gaps in policy between where the SNP and the Greens are. So, we need to actually be practical about our obligations under the climate…under the Paris Agreement and to, you know, deal with this existential threat. And this is a problem that I have with the SNP approach of setting targets and putting their hopes in things like carbon capture when actually there are already practical technologies that work. Upgrading our rail system, investing in renewable technology and upgrading our homes are all things we can do to reduce our emissions right away, no need to wait.
