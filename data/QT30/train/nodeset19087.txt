Now we’re headed for the worst financial recession, economic recession, certainly in Europe. I think we have to ask questions about what’s going wrong. We have to ask those questions honestly. The government has to ask those questions honestly. That’s why it is important that they continue to work with the opposition, to listen to the opposition.
