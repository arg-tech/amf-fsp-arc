Fiona Bruce[00:05:04] Okay, let's see what our audience has got to say about it, Kuabina?
Kuabina[00:05:08] Hi, I just think it's also important to think about the countries that we do travel to. Obviously as us Brits will have the vaccine, that doesn't stop us from transmitting it to other people, and if we do go out to holidays in places like Europe who don't have as many people vaccinated, we could also cause a knock-on effect to those countries. I think we need to be mindful of the effects that we have on those other countries as well, because as we've seen, the pandemic is a global issue, and if it's not fixed in one area, it will always come back to us, so I think that's something we should be mindful of as well.
