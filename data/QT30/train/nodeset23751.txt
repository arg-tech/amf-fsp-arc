[0:52:01] No, no, no, how…when you think about that, how can that possibly be the case when before the pandemic they were managing to see virtually everybody face to face and figures were even higher than 80 per cent, I think most GPs didn't even offer a telephone or online service. So there's no reason why they can't go back to that. The NHS is in receipt of more money than at any other time, and actually, this could be one of the places where the world's changed through coronavirus a lot, and actually there are times, as somebody mentioned, where people might want to see…I can think of occasions where I might just want to phone or have an online appointment, and the fact that a few people do that should actually enable them to get through even more patients. There's no reason why people shouldn't be able to get that face to face and that must be where we end with this.
