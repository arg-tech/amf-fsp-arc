Fiona Bruce[00:00:09] And let’s hear our first question tonight, which is from Charlie Shrimpton.
Charlie Shrimpton[00:01:28] What does it tell us about the government’s priorities that they were forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford so that the poorest people in the country, and especially children, would be fed over the summer holidays?
Fiona Bruce[00:01:41] So, obviously, talking about the free school meal vouchers for children. James?
James Cleverly[00:01:47] Well, coronavirus has meant that we have had to bring about an unprecedented range of support packages for individuals, for businesses, for the self-employed and indeed for families, and we...
Fiona Bruce[00:02:00] Yes, but you weren’t going to do this until Marcus Rashford said.
James Cleverly[00:02:03] And we had…we’d already supported families to help feed their children during the Easter break. And ultimately, we’re trying to get back to a more normal way of working. And we had hoped that we would not need to put this additional support package in place over the summer, but we do listen, the government did listen; and Marcus put forward a really compelling argument and we did listen and the government decided to extend the existing scheme into the summer holidays. I think it was the right thing to do. And ultimately, what we’re trying to do, as I say, is we’re trying to get back towards normality, because really that’s what everyone wants and that’s what we’re working towards.
