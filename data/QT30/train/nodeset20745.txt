Victor Adebowale[0:19:24] I think Becky's question was a good question. We had a 27 percent increase in the number of women who have died as a result of domestic violence. That's at the peak of this, this is about women dying on a daily basis. When are we going to learn? There are things we could be doing, government could be doing. The first thing we could do is start educating young boys. We need to start early about how they treat women around them. How they show respect to themselves and women. That's the first thing we need to do.Secondly, we need to start listening to women about what safety feels like, what it looks like and we need to design our public spaces to meet the needs of women. Because if women feel safe, men feel safe. If men feel safe, boys feel safe and if girls feel safe, everybody feels safe. We could do this tomorrow. We should do this. I noted Mims' point about job centres and the fact you can use code words but I don't think enough people know it.
