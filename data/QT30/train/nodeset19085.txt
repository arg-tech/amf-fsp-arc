Fiona Bruce [00:37:18] Kate, we’ve ranged far and wide in this debate. The original question asked by Martin, when is a café a restaurant, a restaurant a bar, there’s been a lot of talk about that in Scotland, does it differ in Cardiff, Edinburgh, London? Do you think there should be one rule across the United Kingdom? Kate Forbes [00:37:44] No, for two reasons. But I think we want to take a four-nations approach as much as possible. Clarity of messaging is critically important. However, the simpler the message, the harsher it is. If you look at Scotland, for example, I represent the Highlands, which is a different rate of infection than some parts of the central belt. Now we’ve taken action to have stricter restrictions in some parts of the central belt than we do in the -- because it leads to greater compliance, people know what’s going on and there’s higher rates there. That will mean a slight variation in what the restrictions are.
