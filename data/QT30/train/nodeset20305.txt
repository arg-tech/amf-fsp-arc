Fiona Bruce [0:09:04] Angela. Let's bring you in.
Angela Haggerty [0:09:10] I think most governments have been too slow to act on the border issue. If you have been listening to the experts, the scientists they have been saying since the beginning of the pandemic there are clear strategies to follow to limit the impact it has. On a number of occasions the UK has not followed that advice, the border being one example. And we're now in a situation where we have vaccines. It is unprecedented, really, when you think back to the start of the pandemic, we were being told it would be a minimum of 18 months but probably longer, yet here we are less than a year and we are well into the vaccine roll-out programme. That's incredible. But what is vital now is that we try to prevent variants because that's the big threat to the vaccine strategy. The quickest way to get the economy back on track, to do all of these things is to get in control of the virus. So we're only talking about, hopefully, another matter of months before we should have our population as best vaccinated as we possibly can. It is too little too late, but we should be locking down as much as we have to, focussing on the vaccine roll-out, then we can think about moving forward after that.
