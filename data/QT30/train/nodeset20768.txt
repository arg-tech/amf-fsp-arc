Fiona Bruce[0:52:58] Are you persuaded by the fact that at least his fellow co-workers have had secure jobs and income through the pandemic?Victor Adebowale[0:53:10] One of the problems here is the sort of divide and rule. You know, they've had it so good therefore they should suffer. I actually think that's not really good enough. My members tell me, and the leaders of the NHS tell me, that 1 percent isn't good enough. I have to say there is a real risk here. When I look at the fact that more than 14 percent of NHS frontline staff that we desperately need to get us through the other side want to leave as soon as possible. 26 percent are thinking of leaving. So there's a real issue here how we respect the people who have saved lives and done extraordinary work. These are not ordinary jobs. When you are watching someone die and you are there because they can't speak to their relatives, that is a special place. And I think the public think they deserve more than 1 percent, and most of your colleagues do as well.
