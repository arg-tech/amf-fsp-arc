Rosemary Squire[0:49:42] I think we are are all aware of the Suez Canal. You can see the pollution from all of the boats held up, the massive ships, the container ships that were held up by the Sues Kabul. So we are going to be using huge amounts of energy to transport the food. We have lots of food we could be importing 100 miles away. I find that completely counterintuitive. I love Australia, I'm delighted about the three years for young people to go and work there. We are just about to of time over there, but farming and agriculture is massive. It's on a massive scale in Australia. I think the largest farm there is something like the size of the state of Israel. It is going to be a tiny, tiny proportion of food that's going to be coming for Australia, yet for us, I think we could find a better solution closer to home. It seems very strange.
