Tim Stanley[0:51:22] My question is what are the rewards of being vaccinated right now? Once you have been vaccinated and you are in contact with other people that have been vaccinated there surely should be the maximum liberty between those people, and the people in care homes have been vaccinated and the people visiting them have been vaccinated and if we know the vaccination reduces transmission as well as your chances of dying, I don't see why there can't be of greater contact between people. We have to get this right and the very beginning of the crisis, and people in care homes were failed the most because the virus was allowed into the care homes. It feels in some cases as if the people in the care homes have been forgotten, and been left to languish there.

Daisy Cooper[0:52:04] This is heartbreaking and just before Christmas there was lots of evidence coming out about how the lockdown on care homes, under the first wave, carers had been going in and out and waves of Covid but a number of people actually died some pretty traumatic, and distressing deaths because there wasn't enough support. What a lot of people don't realise is that family carers are carers, not just visitors, they do a huge amount of the care in the care home.
