Fiona Bruce [00:38:50] Peter, since we have you here, it is an argument that a number of people have raised, this idea of stratification, as you called it, shielding certain sections of the population, letting others have more freedom, are you convinced by that?[DONE] Peter Openshaw [00:39:04] I think we know if we try that then it is going to eventually work its way up to the most vulnerable. There is very good evidence that the most vulnerable are able to screen themselves off still and there’s a declining rate of disease transmission in those most vulnerable people. But we have seen in many locations when you try to allow the rates to go up a little bit in order to open businesses, inevitably it does percolate through into the vulnerability population. It is a difficult problem. I hope we can get the vaccines into those vulnerable populations so that effect won’t occur. [DONE]
