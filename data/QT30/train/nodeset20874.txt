Adam Price[00:30:10] We've actually seen a real-terms cut in pay of NHS staff going back over ten years. That's why we're facing a problem in terms of recruitment and retention, people are burned out and part of thatâ€¦pay isn't the only thing we need to do, by the way, we need to have more staff in the NHS, we need another 1,000 doctors, 4,000 extra nurses, but pay is part of saying as a society we value you, and I think well done the Scottish Government for showing up the Conservatives what they are, offering a real-terms pay cut to our NHS staff, and we in Wales should at least follow Scotland's lead and that's what I will do as a Plaid Cymru First Minister. 
Fiona Bruce[00:30:55] Andrew, I assume you don't agree with that and you think one per cent is plenty? 
Andrew RT Davies[00:30:58] Well, I notice Adam's just given a pay cut from his first offer which was 12 per cent because when I was on a programme with him recently he was saying that they should have 12 per cent.
