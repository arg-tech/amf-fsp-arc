[00:42:06] Well, you mentioned testing Liz, we have a question on that from Shakeel.Male Aud 6
[00:42:10] Hi,
 okay, so we’ve recruited 25,000 contact tracers, however with today’s 
test and trace results showing that a third of people who are testing 
positive are not providing any details for those close contacts, is the 
system good enough, and is it up to scratch?Fiona Bruce 
[00:42:30]
 Robert, also I’m going to come to you on that, ’cause we’ve had the 
figures out today, from the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. Vaughan, let
 me just start with you. I mean contact traces have been happening in 
Wales for some period of time, but what we don’t know, I think, is how many people are actually being 
contacted, and agreeing to handover their contacts, is that right?Vaughan Gething 
[00:42:50]
 Well, we’ve not had a problem reporting at all. Funnily enough, today I
 had a meeting with our oversight group for our test, trace, 
protect system, and that’s had a very good start to that. Partly because
 we’ve got low numbers, we have less than a hundred people each day who 
are new infections, and we don’t have any kind of significant problem 
with people not giving their data. In the first week of operation, the 
figures [I published 00:43:14] this week, [to add 00:43:17] 659 contacts
 identified [inaudible 00:43:20] given advice to 619 of those contacts, 
that’s a contact rate of 94 per cent.
