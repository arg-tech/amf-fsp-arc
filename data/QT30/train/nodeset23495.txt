Fiona Bruce[0:30:20] Our next question from Jonathan.
AudienceMember 20211111QT10[0:30:22] Without the likes of Russia, India and China on board, are this week's COP-26 breakthrough pledges such as the reduction of methane emissions a glimmer of hope or more blah blah blah?
Fiona Bruce[0:30:38] To quote the words of Greta Thunberg. Paul, not only have you been the head of Unilever for 10 years but you work with the UN as an advocate for sustainability. What's your view on this?
Paul Polman[0:30:52] I'm glad we're talking climate change now and I'm in Glasgow and not London because the issues in London seem to be more trivial than what we're dealing with here in Glasgow. People have discovered the burning issue of climate change and we don't have any time any more. The question is a pertinent one. We need the bigger countries like India, China, Russia, 100 percent on board. But the situation is actually a little bit better than the question would suggest. Before COVID started, we have all worried that nobody was serious to stick to the Paris Agreements, to get to the 1.5 degrees. When COVID came everybody said that's a major distraction, we will not spend time on climate change.
