[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : Most people are going to be living in rental accommodation. There's twice as many people living in rentals now than four years ago, four times as many as 20 years ago. We need a functioning rental sector. Just like one of the people in the audience mentioned, if we do not get the ability to evict tenants, people won't put their houses up for rent. That's what will happen. Then we'll have loads and loads of empty rental stock. That to me is a much bigger problem. What the government has done -- all the governments because this is a devolved matter -- is put measures in place. So even now, even from 1 June, in England, you have to give four months' notice. So it is there are measures in place that take the pandemic into account. But we must have normality because we must have a flourish I didn't work rental sector.
