The big question is why were we pushing for the exit at all? In South Korea, the United States has been there for 70 years. They've got 25,000 troops there. If they had left after to help the years, they would have left at a time when South Korea had a GDP per capita lower than the Congo in a military dictatorship. If you are going to get involved, get involved patiently, and we had a Lightfoot print of 2,000 British and American soldiers that could have remained there with very few casualties at low cost. This was an unnecessary reckless defeat.
