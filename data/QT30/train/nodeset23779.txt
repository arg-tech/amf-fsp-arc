AudienceMember 20210916QT18[0:37:52] What I would like to know is if we develop the AstraZeneca vaccine, as basically, a people's vaccine, why are the Indian facilities us directions for making that to make up for the shortfall for vaccines?
Fiona Bruce[0:38:14] They are, but it's a huge population in India, and they are struggling to get enough vaccine now.
AudienceMember 20210916QT19[0:38:20] In addition, do we need to talk about giving away intellect ual property rights. We could say come on guys you have made a fortune out of selling them, why don't you sell these vaccines to India at cost or use your profits to underwrite the cost of sending vaccines to India.
Fiona Bruce[0:38:44] AstraZeneca, and I'm saying it because they are not here, they are selling the vaccines at cost.
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:38:50] Part of the agreement with Government funding.
Fiona Bruce[0:38:54] Others are not doing that.
Jon Ashworth[0:38:56] What we are seeing in India is desperate and heartbreaking and the stories of oxygen being purchased on the black market because hospitals are overwhelmed. We are seeing pictures of cremations taking place in streets and car parks. For a country like ours and with our deep ties with India, I live in Leicester, we are proud of our bonds with India. Yes we do need to do more! I'm pleased that the Government have done something, and concern calling for them, and we were calling for the Government to take action. We do need to do a lot more.
