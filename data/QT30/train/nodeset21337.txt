[00:53:30] We have the flag flying over Welsh Government buildings, the Union Jack, and we have the Welsh flag as well. There isn't a contradiction in that, and Mark Drakeford's comments aren't about the flag, they're about how the UK works, recognising that power is held in different parts of the UK, and just having a UK government making all the choices when people don't agree with each other isn't the right way forward. It's about remaking the union, it's a voluntary association of the four nations, I think we're all better off, the four countries of the UK together, but we need to have a way for the union to work in the future. Otherwise the danger is we'll end up dividing the UK and we'll see it fall apart. Now that isn't what I want to see, but obviously Wales need to be able to make our own decisions in a whole range of areas that already here in the Welsh Parliament, and that's what people are going to vote on at the start of May.
