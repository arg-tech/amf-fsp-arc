Steve Reed[0:55:34] The government has broken their promises to NHS staff and is offering them a pay cut saying they can't afford it, but they can afford to dole out 2 billion pounds in contracts to their mates.Fiona Bruce[0:55:52] You're saying NHS should get at least 2.1 percent. Ideally, what do you think?Steve Reed[0:56:02] They gave Dominic Cummings a 40 percent pay rise.Fiona Bruce[0:56:08] That's not an answer. What do you think they should get?Steve Reed[0:56:12] They should not get what they promised. A 1 percent pay rise is a real terms pay cut. It is an insult and the government must think again.Mims Davies[0:56:22] I don't think we can bandy round that test and trace doesn't work. 80 percent of that has gone on test, on labs, it's gone on equipment --Steve Reed[0:56:34] A cross-party commitment said it had a marginal impact.Fiona Bruce[0:56:42] (CROSS TALK).Mims Davies[0:56:44] Schools would not be open without test and trace. This is not incompetence. We had a couple of hundred test we can do --Steve Reed[0:56:52] Germany got a statement working for 48 million.Fiona Bruce[0:56:56] The public account committee found no clear evidence that test and trace cut infection.Mims Davies[0:57:04] Despite us contacting 9 million people including the Labour leader who was not at the dispatch box because he had been tested and traced.
