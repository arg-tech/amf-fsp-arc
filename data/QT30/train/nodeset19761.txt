Rachel Clarke [00:22:42] Chris, my heart goes out to you because I was having the kinds of conversations you were having with nurses and doctors when your mum’s life was in the balance in April, and I wouldn’t wish what she and what you as a family have gone through to anybody. There seems to be an increasing, very vocal minority in Britain at the moment who seems to think that somehow if a human being in British society is above a certain age or has medical comorbidities, which might be something as minor as eczema or asthma, then somehow their life is expendable, it doesn’t many anything, it is not worth fighting to save. I, as a doctor, think that is a reprehensible position because it divides British society into two tiers, the tier of people we say are worth saving and the tier we can just do without and expend. So I’m really, really sorry that you are one of the tens of thousands of people who have been through that.
