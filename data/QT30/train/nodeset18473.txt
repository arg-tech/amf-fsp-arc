Fiona Bruce [00:32:13] So, how can you help Rosina?Vaughan Gething [00:32:16] We have a two metre rule in our regulations, we have to consider that, and we’re not about to change the law on that, because I think there’s good evidence actually, that you are safer, you have double the risk having a one metre rule, as opposed to a two metre rule. The Scientific Group on Emergencies, has advised all the governments of the UK on that.Fiona Bruce [00:32:33] Okay.Vaughan Gething [00:32:34] And I’m not about to risk the lives of our citizens, on the basis of what Rocco suggests.Fiona Bruce [00:32:40] So, the conclusion of that is Rosina’s business might go to the wall. Rosina, you’ve got your hand up, let’s hear from you again.Female Aud 3[00:32:48] I’m not saying about reducing the social distancing of two metres, if that’s the law, that’s law. And I think even if you reduced it to one metre, I don’t think that would make a lot of difference, because I think in the mind of the consumer, it’s very much scorched in about the two metre rule, about staying away from other people. I think even if you reduced it to half a metre, I think people are going to stay away. So our dilemma is not just in the next week, or the next two weeks or the next month, I think is a much, much longer longterm problem that the hospitality are going to have.
