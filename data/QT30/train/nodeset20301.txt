Ian Murray[0:02:10] The consequence of that is we're behind the curve. It is still not coming in until the 15th which means tens of thousands of people will be landing into the UK, potentially with new variants of COVID. It is too late. We welcome it, we wish it was every country, it is every country in Scotland, there are big issues about what to be done, how people can access -- how they can pay for them. I have two constituency members, one has gone to the Czech Republic, she doesn't know how she's going to pay for it.

Fiona Bruce[0:02:42] Do you think the taxpayer should pay for it?

Ian Murray[0:02:48] It is Â£1,750. There has to be some way of looking at the system you had before when you come out of this and saying why are we asking people to self-isolate then not checking when they were travelling. It has been a mess. There's a resolution here, but it's too slow, too late, and we are suffering the consequences of that
