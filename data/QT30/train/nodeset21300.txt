Fiona Bruce[00:34:05] Michelle. Does the SNP have a mandate?
Michelle Dewberry[00:34:08] So the Scottish elections, as everyone will know, are slightly more complicated than ours. There's two votes, and I would say that actually Scotland is a country that is almost down the middle divided 50 and 50, because actually when you look at the outcome one of the votes was won very small-y, by pro-union parties, one of them was won by pro-independence parties. 2014 we were told once in a generation, once in a lifetime vote, however I do believe that there isâ€¦that you have to now, the Tories can't block this referendum. The time for this is not now, everyone knows that's obvious, but you can't block this referendum because it's undoubtable that the situation has now changed. In 2014 we were in the EU, we are now not, the landscape has changed. So I do believe that when the time is right, so after all of this pandemic, Scotland should be given the choice as to whether or not they want to stay or leave.
