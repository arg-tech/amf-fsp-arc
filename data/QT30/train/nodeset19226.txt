FIONA BRUCE Would you be happy to take the vaccine? JAY UNKNOWN [00:33:26] I’m probably one of the cautious people, to be fair. I’d rather wait and see what the effect is first of all. I mean... 
FIONA BRUCE [00:33:36] So at the moment you’re not sure? Merryn, you wanted in.[DONE] 
MERRYN SOMERSET [00:33:42] I just wanted to say that I’m not -- there is a big trust issue around vaccines and looked at the different surveys you can see that between 7 and 25 percent of people will say they are suspicious of a new vaccine like this. So there does need to be some kind of campaign around the safety and reminding everybody of the efficacy of the vaccines that we’ve had over the last couple of hundred years. It is important to remember back in the 1800s, 20, 30 percent of kids died before they were 5. We put in place a vaccine programme since that has brought that down to one in a couple of hundred. But there is around this idea of trust, trust probably a very simple way to make the general population believe in the vaccine and trust in the vaccine and perhaps, at the same time, to increase a little trust in our politicians, which obviously has fallen off quite substantially over the last 9 months. I would suggest that, Matt, you have the vaccine first, and then every other MP has it, and we can rush it out to a couple of top civil servants as well. We wait two weeks, everything is fine, then you can start rolling it out to everybody else.[DONE]
