[00:53:36] Amanda?
 Amanda King [00:53:42] I’m actually one of the few individuals who’s a sole trader who actually runs what is classed as an essential business on the high street. But there’s been these grants, and that’s great, but it is clear it is for those businesses that have to close. Yet we are on the high street, there’s just us, the butchers and a doctor. There’s nobody going past our shop for us to sell goods to. 
 Fiona Bruce [00:54:22] You run a pet shop, don’t you, Amanda? [DONE]
Amanda King [00:54:28] I have got a pet shop, yes. We’re not selling any animals. It’s not appropriate. But it’s pet food. Consequently people are staying at home, which is good but, really, the only people passing us are going to the butcher or they’re sick, going to the doctor and they want to go home. There is no support for us. The saddest thing about it is to keep open we’re having to reduce our hours to make sure I can keep my staff going who were all self-employed. We fall, yet again, through the gaps and we don’t get anything.[DONE]
