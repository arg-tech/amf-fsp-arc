Tony Danker [0:06:52] It is wise we go slow enough to avoid the stop start. But if you are in the hospitality or aviation or live events sector, it's not good news, so the budget has to tackle that.
Fiona Bruce [0:07:06] Let's hear from the audience. James, I'll come back to you in a minute. Colette.
Audience Member 3 [0:07:12] I would like to clarify something. I have beauty salons, we have both been treated incredibly disproportionately. You can't get a drink in a beauty salon. Secondly, I think we share the same frustration in business. We are chomping at the bit to get back into business. The reason for that is because there's absolutely inadequate government support. We have been secluded from grants. Many councils are not putting through grants for businesses. The permanent care sector has been secluded from VAT cuts. We have the issue where we are secluded from government aid. All James is looking for, quite rightly, business needs to give employees answers. We need to budget and plan. We are running out of cash fast and we don't want to hear from the government again of what their financial matters are or how many loans we can get.
