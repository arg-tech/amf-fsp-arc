Keith Brown[00:48:30] But if I can just say, the NHS I think has done a fantastic job through the pandemic. They are tired, doubtless, but they've done a fantastic job.
Fiona Bruce[00:48:35] Well, let's hear from someone who works for the NHS who happens to be in our audience. Pippa, you're a junior doctor, I think?
Pippa Unknown[00:48:40] Yeah, that's right. I think it was referenced earlier the idea of a national care service. And my experience over the last year is that that's one of our main problems, not having safe and available places to discharge elderly and frail patients to. They're not always benefiting from acute admissions to hospitals and then they get a bit stuck and in hospital they're at risk of hospital carried infections, including COVID. And I think that's got to be one of the main points for discussion when we're discussing moving the health service in Scotland forward.
