Fiona Bruce[00:13:40] Okay, Claire, you wanted to come back in? Claire Fox[00:13:41] I just wanted to clarify, I mean, we keep being told, you know, we have to follow the data not the dates, but actually the data is well ahead of where we thought it would be. We're told that we should listen to the experts and in fact the experts have stressed that the different variants from different countries, you know, this idea of a foreign variant versus a domestic, there's going to be variants on a virus like this, homegrown or foreign, and you don't want to get into a xenophobic anti-foreign point here. And that actually what's different, Adam has just mentioned last summer, is that we have the vaccination and that means that largely speaking the threat of the different variants are not as severe, at all, and my concern is that although we talk about following the science and following the data,actually these end up being kind of politically driven cautious decisions…I mean, I don't mind if people have staycations, that's fine, but I am concerned about carrying on this kind of talk of…which effectively induces fear in people, makes them frightened, when they don't need to be.
