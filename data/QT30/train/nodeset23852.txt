AudienceMember 20210819QT06[0:14:34] Would a Labour defeat in Hartlepool and elsewhere in the red wall areas mean curtains for Keir?
Fiona Bruce[0:14:44] Whether they're John Lewis curtains or other kind of curtains.
Thangam Debbonaire[0:14:52] I found it extraordinary that anybody looking down on John Lewis curtains. It is too early in the day to say what is going to happen.
Fiona Bruce[0:15:02] It is too early but, nonetheless, it is looking like you have a fight on your hands.
Thangam Debbonaire[0:15:10] Every vote we have fought for. We have incredible candidates. I have spoken to voters in Hartlepool, all over the country. People have been listening to the Labour Party, been willing to talk to us.
Fiona Bruce[0:15:26] What's the answer to this question?
Thangam Debbonaire[0:15:28] It's too much hypotheticals.
Fiona Bruce[0:15:32] Let's take one issue. Would a Labour defeat in heart pool be curtains for ear.
Thangam Debbonaire[0:15:40] It is far too early to say.
Fiona Bruce[0:15:44] The polls are into the looking positive.
Thangam Debbonaire[0:15:48] There are a load of results going to be taking place over the next few days. We have worked hard. I think it beho listen very carefully to what the voters are saying. Whatever they say, whatever we get to at the end, which is not clear yet, I think it is important that people have moved away from the disaster that was the 2019 General Election.
Fiona Bruce[0:16:14] I guess you'll find out.
Hugh Osmond[0:16:18] I think in a democracy every government needs a strong opposition. That's good for democracy. We have not got a strong opposition at the moment. I think that is a disaster. I, myself, I don't know what Labour stands for at the moment. It certainly doesn't seem to stand for standing up for the young, hard-working people who have been most affected by lockdown and the underprivileged voter base.
