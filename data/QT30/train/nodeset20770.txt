Fiona Bruce[0:57:16] 1 percent, is that enough?
Dan Hodges[0:57:18] I don't think it is. I think probably NHS staff do deserve better pay increase than that, but possibly not because of the reasons put forward. I find it quite patronising, actually, some of this argument, this idea that the NHS staff especially deserve a pay increase because over the last 12 months they have been doing incredible work saving lives. I'm not sure what people think NHS staff do when there isn't a pandemic. The reality is the decision on public sector pay should be based on two criteria. What sort of level and quality of public services do we want and what sort of level of public services can we afford?
