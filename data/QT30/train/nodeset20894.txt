Fiona Bruce[00:42:26] And which party do you think will it benefit the most, that's the question? Kate Unknown[00:42:31] I do think that it would probably…I get the vibe that it would probably help Plaid or the Green Party or someone more like that, at the moment. Fiona Bruce[00:42:45] You supported this, Adam, reducing the vote to 16, is that because you thought you'd get more votes that way? Adam Price[00:42:51] No, I think…Fiona Bruce[00:42:52] Really? Adam Price[00:42:54] No, I think Tim's right, I mean, we all benefit by having our young people right at the heart of a democracy, we all gain, and I think that the party that will benefit the most is the one that presents the most inspiring vision of the future and that's up to all of us in the next few weeks. Now I hope that it will be our party, but, you know, none of us should take young people for granted, and ultimately I think there is interestingly a very clear pattern, though, isn't there, that independence has the highest support amongst 16 to 24 years old, and I don't think that's any accident, you know?
