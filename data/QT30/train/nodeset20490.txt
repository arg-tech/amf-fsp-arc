Audience Member 3[0:08:12] I think, apparently, we have the worst death rates per capita internationally yet our financial stimulus package, compared to other countries by GDPR is the third lowest. Quite frankly, it is time the government said what they would do at the beginning, which was we will do whatever it takes. If you are listening, whatever it takes, if you want business to open, you have to back business. We cannot save jobs unless you give us funding.
Audience Member 4[0:08:50] I have my point would be that it sends the wrong message out. I really, you know, feel sorry for James and other like him. Actually, as a layperson that isn't in the industry, the message the government is sending out is that somehow it is less safe because that's why you have to wait longer. The problem, therefore, will be even when you do open, people will perhaps not be as willing to go to restaurants as they used to. So you need to actually realise it is about confidence, and the confidence you instill in the public. Your answer to Grant was not very good, if you don't mind me saying, because you didn't deal with the question.
