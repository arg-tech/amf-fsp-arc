Nick Ferrari[0:43:04] Whether it takes him to go to New York, Washington to do a videolink, whatever it takes to put this out of the way to let the Queen power on and do the job that I think she does particularly well, I'd urge him to do that. (APPLAUSE).Fiona Bruce[0:43:18] Lisa, should Prince Andrew go to the States and see his accuser in court?Lisa Nandy[0:43:32] Before Parliament, I worked with young girls who were preyed on by gangs and suffered the most horrendous circumstances. Every bit of the system is stacked against those young women, and sometimes young men, who come forward to allege abuse. It takes incredible bravery to do it and, whilst I'm not trying to prejudge any legal action in this case, I'm saying the fact that they don't have access to people in power and the fact that they're not believed and the fact so many times there is pressure put on them and their families to just shut up and go away instead of rocking the boat, all of that makes it far, far more important that people who are in positions of power adhere to the highest possible standards in these cases. That means being open. It means being transparent and it means making every effort to support the effort to have a fair hearing and a fair trial. So I agree with Nick and I think it is time some action was taken.
