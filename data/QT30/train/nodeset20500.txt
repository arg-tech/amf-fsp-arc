Anneliese Dodds[0:20:50] I'm sure you have, as well, with respect, Grant, and I wish be your government would put its mindset into the position of some of these businesses rather than being driven by politics.Grant Shapps[0:21:02] I think you're the one who is playing politics with this. The idea that we can't wait until next Wednesday to have a full budget which is part 2 of this and actually sets out all the detail behind this roadmap -- I mean, if you ever became chancellor, are you saying you're not going to have budgets in order to do these things? Of course it is the right way to don't it.Fiona Bruce[0:21:22] Tony.Tony Danker[0:21:26] I believe it is the prime minister and the government's decision to weigh up these factors. I think the support package from the chancellor has been generous to date. I think the thing the government is missing -- and you can understand why, they are managing a significant crisis, they don't understand business decision-making, the timescales of it. We miss the fact that hospitality missed its golden quarter in the last quarter of the year.
