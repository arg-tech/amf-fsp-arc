Emily Thornberry[0:51:44] We had a million homes built in the last few years that haven't been properly insulated. They will need to be retro fitted. So we need to be putting much more into heat pumps, of course we do, to make sure people can have them. We need to regulate new homes to make sure they are built properly, we need to put the money into insulation. It is not sexy talking about insulating your loft, but that is the sort of things people need to do. How will anybody, even if they can afford an electric car, what's the point if you can't charge it? People don't want to go halfway up a motorway and run out of electricity. It doesn't work. They are not putting the money into the infrastructure. They are all talk and not doing it sufficiently seriously.

AudienceMember 20211111QT18[0:52:34] A lot of this comes to the cost of the person. Being in Eastleigh we're close to an airport and a station which have fantastic ability to get anywhere. But if I wanted to go to Edinburgh, I can't get there for £30 on a flight. If I used the train it would be well over £100. I want to drive to be green, but that choice is taken away from me. The same is I would love to have an electric car but I live in a terraced house.
