Fiona Bruce [00:17:02] Different measures have been taken at different times. David Ross [00:17:04] I agree with Susan, it comes down to communication. Nicola Sturgeon is a very good communicator. She is on our television every day in Scotland doing the daily briefings. But when it comes down to the detail, we still have, as you said Fiona, the highest R rate anywhere in the United Kingdom, the highest percentage of death in care homes anywhere in the United Kingdom. One of the highest death rate per head of population in Europe. So there are clear challenges that we have to face. As Sir Ian said, we have to learn from the mistakes we made. We are 7 months into this pandemic now and weâ€™re probably closer to where we were in March than we are at the end of this crisis. We have a lot to go through, to learn from, and we cannot make the same mistakes that have been made before. [Unreportable cross-talk.]
