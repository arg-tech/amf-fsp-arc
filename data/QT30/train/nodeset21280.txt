Tony Unknown[00:13:45] They've just squandered Â£50 million of public money building themselves a new headquarters on a flood plain next to the River Wear, unbelievable. And then spent more money for flood defences, and then spent even more money to have a roof terrace. Where does it all end? Because they didn't listen they've been voted out and that's going to happen and happen again. So, Lisa, you should take the message back to your leaders, start listening to what the public wants, start listening and you might get some good advice.Fiona Bruce[00:14:12] Kate, let's come to you.Kate Forbes[00:14:14] Well, talking about elections, and we've had a lot of talk of elections already this evening, we've just had one in Scotland in which the majority of voters rejected Labour and the Conservatives, and so the SNP get the biggest vote share in the history of the Scottish Parliament. And it's a very appropriate question, because we've seen the Labour Party get their worst result in Scotland, they've lost seats, they've seen the worst vote share and I guess having changed leaders both in Scotland and across the UK it's quite clear it wasn't about the messenger, it's about the message. You can change the leader, but that's not changing the results. And my question would be what does Labour stand for, because there's two key flaws, as I see it, from Scotland.
