Jeane Freeman[0:41:58] There is an independent review of whether or not the first minister broke the code of conduct. She says no, and I believe her. Secondly, there is an independent review that will go through due process. Secondly, the first minister said from the outset that she will appear in front of that committee, under oath, and answer all questions that it has. So the idea that she is trying to hide away in some way couldn't be further from the truth, and you know it.

Stephen Fitzpatrick[0:42:26] I am delighted to say I don't have very much to say about this. There's a lot of he said, they said, she said, I am delighted not to have to be too much party to this discussion. When I travel back home to Belfast, there's a lot of local politics. When I travel to Scotland, the same. When I go to travel abroad, we have business all over the world, and the Scottish people are united when they travel. British people are united when we travel, always when we're at home these things appear. I'm delighted not to have much to say.
Fiona Bruce[0:43:06] Okay, you stay out of it.
