Fiona Bruce[00:44:46] But will this deal be a good thing?
Nadhim Zahawi[00:44:47] Well, let's wait and see what this deal looks like. It will absolutely be one that protects our high quality farming, our animal husbandry. That is not for negotiation. So let's wait and see what the deal looks like. But if you step back a second it's actually a good thing, as Harriet says, that we are negotiating trade deals for ourselves and we make those decisions and we have to go out and explain to our public as to why these things are good and how we're protecting…
Fiona Bruce[00:45:15] Well, that's why I'm asking what… But we're not really getting the details from the government.
Nadhim Zahawi[00:45:18] Well, no. But what I'm saying to you is until we have the details we can't really have a discussion as the details at the moment are being negotiated. All I would say to our farmers is that the high quality of farming and animal husbandry is not to be negotiated. That is not to be compromised in any trade deal negotiation.
