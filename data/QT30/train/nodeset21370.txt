Fiona Bruce[00:07:37] Dale.
Dale Unknown[00:07:41] It's common sense that we close the borders until we know about the Indian variant and how that's going to pan out, because it's only going to get worse, and then there's going to be another lockdown and we're just going to be in this whole cycle all over again. So in the first lockdown everything should have been closed, the borders should have been closed, no flights coming in, no going out, until we know exactly what we're dealing with. Because at the moment with the Indian variant we haven't actually got a clue.
Fiona Bruce[00:08:11] Okay. Harriet, let me come to you as former head of Thomas Cook. Should we be abandoning trips abroad for the next few weeks or for the summer?
Harriet Green[00:08:18] I think you can hear by the exchange, and I think the frustration and the confusion and the sense of we can, we can't really I think causes more harm than good. So I think, as we just heard, the exchange frustrates us all. If I was the head of a travel company I would be very frustrated in terms of you have regulations, you have a change of traffic light system, you engage with certain vacations and certain approaches. So I think there is real frustration. I do think when we come on to talk about why caution is required and what is really happening in the world and in other parts of the world that we can learn from that some of what Carlos and Dale and Sam have said is worth listening to. But it is so frustrating right now.
