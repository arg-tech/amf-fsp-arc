Gareth Jones[00:25:15] Good evening. The current app development is experiencing problems – if we don’t get it working, does it really matter? Will it make a difference to prevent a second wave?
Fiona Bruce[00:25:25] Does it really matter, Lisa Nandy?
Lisa Nandy[00:25:27] Yeah, I think it does matter and, you know, we very much supported the government in trying to set this up, because in the end if you get the app up and running it will save lives. The problem is that the government were warned repeatedly from the outset that the path that they were taking was not going to work because the technology just wasn’t compatible with a lot of phones. Now, there were other countries like Germany and Australia, who were taking a similar path to our government, trying to develop their own technology, realised that it wouldn’t work, listened to those warnings, and actually went down a different path. And as a result Germany has just managed to launch their app yesterday and is quite confident about how that’s going to work. So, we’ve really got to start breaking the pattern here, which is of a government that shuts people out, doesn’t listen to advice, doesn’t seek to learn from expertise here in the UK and overseas, and then finds later that they’ve got to revisit those plans because they’ve unravelled very very quickly. We’ve seen it over and over again with a whole host of things.
