 Humphrey Cobbold [00:14:40] I think Annaliese is right in terms of the progress that needs to happen now. It can't be much of a surprise that we need to do a rapid vaccine roll-out. We’ve known about this for 9 months, at some time we were going to have to do this. It is a logistics and planning exercise. We heard before the show that good people are involved, but I think you’ll find, Nadhim, there is a willingness across the population and across businesses to do whatever you need, whatever is required to accelerate and deliver this vaccine. I’ve got 270 sites around the country of gyms, the size of 3 or 4 tennis courts, I have memorandum on if you are low the government are paying, we and I’m sure every business in our situation that have been battered, frankly, by this virus, our biggest interest collectively as a country is seeing us come through this as swiftly as possible. You guys tell us what you need, we’ll make what’s available to you, what’s necessary, do anything in our power to make that happen. But let’s accelerate the process and be truly ambitious. If we can do 1 million a week, why can’t we do 4 million a week. There’s enough people, enough goodwill in this country to make that happen. I’m confident of that. [DONE]
