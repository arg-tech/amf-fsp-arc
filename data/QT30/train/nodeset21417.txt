Nadhim Zahawi
[00:50:13] In Israel, absolutely right. And we need to strain every sinew, as I think the US administration is equally committed to to get to a sustainable two state solution.

[00:50:27] Harriet.

Harriet Green
[00:50:28] Yes, I agree with Nadhim, and I think that there's also a dimension in the horror of this that we have all seen. The extent to which fake news is used by all parties to intensify the suffering. It adds no value other than to escalate and to polarise.

Fiona Bruce
[00:50:50] And what you're referring to there is a number of videos that have been circulated online from both sides which have been showing violence that actually either took place at a different time or was actually in a different country.

Harriet Green
[00:51:01] Different wars, different time.

Fiona Bruce
[00:51:01] So in terms of the UK and the international community trying to find a long lasting solution… I mean, what we've seen in the last few days has been horrifying…

Harriet Green
[00:51:10] Yeah.

Fiona Bruce
[00:51:10] We now have a ceasefire. Who knows how fragile that is.

Harriet Green
[00:51:13] Yes.
