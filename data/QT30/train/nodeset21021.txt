[00:30:30] But there's actually a wider North East economy point here, because Aberdeen in the surrounding areas is facing a crisis around oil and gas but it's also got a crisis around the hospitality industry and a crisis around the tourism industry. There is a real economic crisis in the North East and this is one of the reasons why recovery is so important. When we talk about recovery it just can't be a campaign slogan, it has to actually be a national mission. And the North East is a perfect example of that. Unless we push power and resource out from our parliament into the different parts of Scotland so they can invest in individual sectors, for example, the renewable industry...

Fiona Bruce
[00:31:08] Yeah, but Anas, in fairness, I know this is what you want to make in terms of your manifesto but the question is very specifically, how do you view the long-term future of oil and gas workers?

Anas Sarwar
[00:31:16] Well, the long-term future has to be one in which we transition to a renewables future, but we've got to start that hard work now.
