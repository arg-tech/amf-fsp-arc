Fiona Bruce[0:16:36] Let me bring in the rest of the Panel. Rosemary. Forgive me. Sarah, Labour supports the idea of delaying for four weeks.

Sarah Jones[0:16:50] I'm enormously sympathetic.

Fiona Bruce[0:16:52] But not persuaded.

Sarah Jones[0:16:54] No, the fact we have the highest infection rates in Europe, which is a league table we didn't want to top again, means we have to lock down, unfortunately. There's only one reason we are delaying this roadmap, it is the Delta variant, and there's only one reason it is as rampant as it is across the UK, and that's because this government was too slow to close the borders. It is absolutely clear one has caused the other. What the government needs to do now is to put in place alongside the public health measures an economic support measure as well. So your case in point about theatres but, you know, I was talking to a pub-owner in my constituency yesterday who has just cancelled all the live music she planned for July. All of those musicians devastated. They will get no support. We have to extend furlough, business rates relief, we have to sort out proper payment for isolation. It is horrific the news we had today that the government was trying to hide information about how people could self-isolate and we have to look at how people are going to pay back some of these loans as well
