No, in the northeast of England the left failed to provide decent representation as happened prior to that in Scotland where your party was completely wiped out because they were so poor at doing their own job of representing the people that they are elected by. What I have seen -- we have both been to Batley. What I saw in Batley is what I saw in the red seats during 2019. A lot of people unhappy with a Labour Party taxes up. Whether it is a demonisation of Corbyn or not. A Labour Party that wasn't pat yobbic, whether true or not, that was the perception. They do think that, as it were, the Tory offering of levelling up is what them the. They feel neglected not over 10 years, over 50 years. Over my adult lifetime they feel neglected. I have some sympathy with that.

When will that moment look right for you to try to get a seat in Westminster?
