Fiona Bruce[0:35:00] Another question from Vanessa.
Audience Member 12[0:35:02] Good evening. Matt Hancock claimed there never was a national PPE shortage during the pandemic. I find this quite disrespectful to all the healthcare workers that have been fighting for their safety during the pandemic. So can the government explain why they think there were no shortages?
Fiona Bruce[0:35:20] I'll let you catch your breath, Grant. Anneliese?
Anneliese Dodds[0:35:26] I think it has been very difficult to explain why there were no shortages because we know there were shortages. I know that myself from having talked to health professionals, people who were deeply frustrated, who were actually in some cases quite frightened, to be honest with you, about the working situation. They were at that frontline. I think it is deeply disappointing that we don't have the openness about what went wrong. Somebody mentioned earlier -- I can't remember who it was -- it was Jeremy, who said we need to learn from what happened during this crisis. We need to understand, you know, when there were those problems with supply, how we can make sure that we don't end up in that position again. I think that's critically important. Let's be honest about this. Let's learn from those at the frontline so we can ensure they have what they need into the future.
