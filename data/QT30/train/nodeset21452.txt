[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : Anybody involved in the business, for instance, of music festivals, or festivals of any kind, there are still so many people who are not able to fully engage in the economy, and I don't think the virus is going away. I mean, the question was what scientific advice do we listen to. To my mind, the evidence -- we should listen to all the scientific advice but we have to find a way to let business operate.And the sooner we can do that, the sooner the tax take will increase then we will have more money for things like education that I think have much bigger long term implications.
 
[FIONA BRUCE] : I appreciate you are not a scientist, but do you think restrictions should carry on after 21 June or be lifted then or possibly sooner?

[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : If anything, I would like to see restrictions lifted sooner but I would like to see us work out a way to live with it on a longer term basis. We are going to be living with this virus for a very long time. What's going to happen on 21 June, there will be another date and another date. We need a permanent long-term solution. Business cannot live with this kind of knee-jerk reaction. The reaction to me is much too immediate and not really long term enough.
