Adam Price [00:11:53] I think in terms of international travel, you know, I agree with Nigel, really, look, we all want to get back to the position where we can have all the liberties back, the freedoms that we lost, but I think so many people have sacrificed and we don't want to risk what we've gained in terms of driving the level of the virus right down. 

You know, last summer the importation of cases, we don't want to risk that and particularly the biggest uncertaintyâ€¦ there are a lot of positives at the moment, aren't there? I mean, the vaccination programme, the effect that's having, even the weather is in favour of us now, so the wind is in our sails a little bit but the one area of deepest uncertainty is about these variants of concern, as they're described, which of course have some degree of immunity to the effect of the vaccine, and that's the one area where I think that's a flashing red sign, let's hold off, let's be cautious, so that we don't endanger the gains that we've managed to achieve so far.
