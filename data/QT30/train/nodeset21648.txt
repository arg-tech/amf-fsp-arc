Fiona Bruce[0:06:36] Just listening to the point a number of people have put since this all broke, which is why should we follow the rules when we have seen those in the highest office not doing so.
Benjamin Zephaniah[0:06:48] I think David said something really important. Boris Johnson was a journalist. The problem is he thinks he can still act like a journalist. He is a politician leading the country, so he has to lead by example. During this whole last year, five, six months, whatever it is, I've come across many occasions when people are breaking the rules. When they are breaking the rules they are referring to Dominic Cummings, all these kinds of things. I don't think politicians are anybody special but people do look to them for leadership. Right now it is not an ordinary time. We really need leadership. If Boris Johnson or any other politicians feel they can act like a journalist or act like a businessman or something like that, no, we need political leadership because it is very difficult for me to speak about these things without being emotional. Covid-19 has really affected me and my family. My sister buried people, that was her job, then we got the virus. So when we came here tonight, the Question Time Panel, we were careful. If we have the rulers of our country and their friends not being good examples, what hope have we got for the rest of the people?
