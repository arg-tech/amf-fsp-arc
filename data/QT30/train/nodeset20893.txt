[00:47:09] I've been a supporter of votes at 16 long before I was elected to the council, when I was a councillor for one term before I was a member of the Senedd, so I think it's the right thing to do from a principle point of view, I think that at the age of 16 there are lots of responsibilities that we impose on people at that age, and I think people have the right to choose who will make decisions on their behalf. Talking about young people being the carers and the engineers of the future, of course young people can already work.
