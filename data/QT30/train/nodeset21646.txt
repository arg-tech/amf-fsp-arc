Madeline Grant[0:27:06] What the government must, must make sure of is that the way the education system was dealt with has to be really addressed properly. It has to be looked at. Make a plan that, actually, this is going to come back at some point. Maybe not in 2022, it could come back in 2023. Look at the children who did home schooling. Some of them had 60 minutes a day of Zoom classes. 60 minutes. If we are saying that -- my view is it was not handled very well at all. You could say nobody knew it was coming and so we were -- the government were on the back foot. But now that we know a virus of some sort does come up every so often, we have to make a firm plan of these children in state schools, from these lower socio-economic backgrounds who have parents that don't speak the language, who have parents that work full time, the mental health of children, the impact on -- some of them are three, four months behind where they should be. What can we do to ensure that when we do go back into a lockdown and with the rising variant --Fiona Bruce[0:28:18] If we do. Who knows if we will go back into a lockdown. Some think we will, some don't.
