Fiona Bruce[0:41:02] The crisis is now. Should we be sending vaccines now do you think?Jon Ashworth[0:41:06] Of course. But Fiona, it's not as simple as saying send the vaccines.Fiona Bruce[0:41:10] No I'm just asking the question.Jon Ashworth[0:41:12] What we are facing with India, they have got the same institute, they can produce 70 million vaccines a month, part of the issue with India is investment in the Primary Care network to distribute the vaccines. It's about investment in the health infrastructure to get oxygen out to people. What the crisis has told us as Daisy says, we are not safe till everywhere is safe. That's not a political slogan that's a scientific fact. While the virus continues to circulate across the world, it will mutate, and bounce-back and hit us and could set us back. We have examples of the Indian variant here in the UK and we have got it in Leicester, and parts of London. It's why we have to act now.Fiona Bruce[0:41:56] You had your hand up?AudienceMember 20210916QT20[0:41:58] Yes, I mean, I think it's a little sad that we have to use an argument of self-interest in order to rationalise and justify sending things in India when they are in a dire state. I don't think that argument is particularly helpful.
