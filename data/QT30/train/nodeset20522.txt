Jo Grady [0:48:30] I'm going to endorse the point that listening to professionals is vital to anything that happens going forward. I think with regard to the exact question, I think catch-up is a bit of a distraction, particularly for schools, particularly colleges and universities. Learning never stops, work never stops, we don't close in the summer. There's all sorts of preparation. The idea that people stop working and can invest time in catch-up is, in itself, problematic. To address the question, if there's going to be funding made available, and this will cost money, disadvantaged children taking part in play, in sports, funding for meal clubs, all of the things that families, teachers, children have been asking for I think is what will be crucial in the summer, not some idea of catch-up to pass SATs or pass exams and chanelling money where it is needed and engaging professionals in those conversations, not dictating to them yet more demands on their time.
