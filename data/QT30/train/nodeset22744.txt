Fiona Bruce[0:54:45] And, Nick, can I let you come back in, because we lost you for a bit there before you managed to finish your point. 
Nick Thomas-Symonds MP[0:54:51] Thank you, Fiona. Not sure what happened there. Just to say first of all that Chris mentions about threat to the economy. The biggest threat to the economy is a virus that we're just simply not on top of and is out of control. Now, to get the virus under control we need obviously the testing system but we need the tracing system, and for you to have an effective tracing system you need to be tracing over 80 per cent of the contacts. Now, here in Wales with a locally led system we're over the 80 per cent figure. That unfortunately isn't the case in England. And the reason we're arguing for that circuit breaker in England is to give that opportunity to get that system to work. But also too, just to be clear, we're not suggesting that in that scenario the schools should close. We should do all we can to keep schools open because we know the damage it does to educational attainment with children being out of school. But the reality is we are in the situation in England where the government has lost control of the virus and the time is slipping away from them to actually take this measure and getting a circuit break in place to try and get back in control and get back on top of testing and tracing.
