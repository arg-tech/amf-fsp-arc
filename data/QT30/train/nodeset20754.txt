AudienceMember 20210318QT21[0:37:24] I think the question of the Royal Family being racist or not is a confusing one. I saw the interview. I didn't know when the supposed remarks were made. Were they made when the couple got married? Were they made when the baby was on their way? Were they, as Megan's father suggested, a crass way of wondering, as any family is curious, is this baby going to have its grandfather's big ears? Is this baby going to have red hair? Etcetera, etcetera. So I honestly can't answer the question is the Royal Family racist. But I can say the British tabloid press is bigoted and racist to its core. That to me is mainly what has driven that couple to leave this country. The way the tabloid press ripped into that woman and used every opportunity and used race as its main weapon. Why the tabloid press -- we have history here. They did exactly the same thing with Fergie and Diana. They seem to think if you have two women in the Royal Family married to two princes they must be at loggerheads and, if they're not, we'll create it.
