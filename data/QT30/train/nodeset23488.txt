[0:39:14] I want to challenge some of the language around the sacrifice. I think one of the most frustrating things about this discussion is the fact that what's possible here is the possibility of a better quality of life for all of us. It doesn't have to be around sack cloth and ashes. This is about the possibility, for example, of having every single home properly insulated. A proper house by house, street by street locally authority led programme that gets fuel bills down, creates millions of jobs. One of my favourite cartoons has a professor in front of a whiteboard. On the whiteboard they listed all the advantages of moving to a zero carbon economy, free or affordable public transport, properly insulated homes. Then there's a student with a speech bubble coming out of their mouths: What if climate change is a hoax and we created a better world for no reason. There's a real change of creating that better world, and realised that public opinion is miles ahead of government. They want bolder action, looks at every single opinion poll where it is clear that people want to act. Look at the fact that climate change be acceptable -- come up with far bolder things that governments ever do. For those people taking many, many flights, just 15 percent of the population take 70 percent of the flights. Once you start taking more than one flight in a year that ratchets up. People like there -- they want to see a ban on high carbon products being advertised. There are some win wins here. We should be able to talk about those and bringing people with us.
