Sarah Jones [00:19:28] It’s almost like when you are a parent and you think your kids are the best and the cutest, but you don’t tell all the other parents you have the best and the cutest. It seems crass to say we’re the best country, aren’t we great. Oh it was because of Brexit, that was my policy. That’s not the point of what we’re we’re doing here. As it happens, I worked on the Olympics, I did a lot of work about global branding what the world thinks about us. As it happens, the world has a good view of us in terms of our ability to make things, get things done. If something is made in Great Britain, people trust it around the world. We are high up in terms of respect for what we do and who we are. We don’t need to use crass comments and shout about it. People know we’re good at science and we’re good at what we do, but so is the rest of the world. This is a time for all of us to celebrate what has happened, to come together, and not to try to make some cheap points, I think.
