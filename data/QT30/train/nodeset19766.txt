Fiona Bruce [00:57:08] You weren’t criticising those grants to the supermarkets at the time. Anneliese Dodds [00:57:16] We have said that we think support should be better targeted. We did point to the fact that, for example in Labour-run-Wales, they didn’t have that grant support going to the very, very large companies. If you look at the self-employed income grant, you got with the initial phases of that exactly the same amount if your profit had gone down by £1 as if it had been wiped out completely. Now the point is, again going back to what Dave said before, it is not dwelling on the past it is looking to the future. What do we need to do now? We need to have a longer term timescale. We saw yet again, the prime minister earlier this week, new restrictions, no word about economic importance, then the chancellor running to catch up. We need a longer term plan for businesses, especially those who have a lot of debt now. The kind of pubs like James’ and others where they racked up that debt. How can we help them in the future to keep their staff on, hopefully getting additional staff in place as well?[DONE]
