Fiona Bruce[00:31:55]You say Lisa won't accept it, Keir Starmer said in January last year of course if there's a pro-independence majority it has to be looked at in Westminster, I don't think it's right to block anything. So that sounds like, yes, Labour thinks the SNP does have a mandate for a second independence referendum.
Lisa Nandy[00:32:10] Well, no, I think Nicola Sturgeon can't have it both ways. She said very clearly in these elections that people could happily vote for the SNP if they were pro remaining in the United Kingdom, safe in the knowledge that they would be voting for an SNP government with a much broader agenda and a broader set of elections. Now she's claiming that she has a mandate from those people for independence. It was a hoax, frankly. It was exactly the same during the 2014 referendum when she and Alex Salmond said that this was a once in a generation opportunity to settle the question and now they're saying that they want to reopen the question.
Fiona Bruce[00:32:41] So when Keir Starmer said I don't think it's right to block anything, what is your policy?
Lisa Nandy[00:32:47] I don't think you can claim that this is a mandate for independence when Nicola Sturgeon herself went out and sought votes on the basis that you could be pro the future of the United Kingdom and Scotland in the United Kingdom and still vote for the SNP.
