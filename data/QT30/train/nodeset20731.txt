Bonnie Greer[0:05:20] We have to have women in place at the highest levels in our media, in government --
Fiona Bruce[0:05:30] We have a female Home Secretary, of course.
Bonnie Greer[0:05:36] I want to talk about an attitude, too, okay? Where a woman is clear -- I'm not saying the Home Secretary isn't -- but I think we need not someone doing other things, we need a dedicated person to this issue. Especially someone in your generation, because your generation isn't going to take it any more. And so what we do need are these women in place in the long run. And what they begin to do is they educate, especially the younger generations, boys particularly, to understand and learn how to respect women. In doing that, they respect themselves. This is a five or ten year emergency situation, dedicated. Then I think we can begin to sort of see it level out.
