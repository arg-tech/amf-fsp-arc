[LUCY FRAZER] : We protected tenants for a long time and it is important we did that because we didn't want anyone to be thrown out of their houses during this period. 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Why have you lifted it now? 
[LUCY FRAZER] : It is also important that landlords can take control where it is necessary to do so. And there will be a period of time, of course, where tenants will be able to settle themselves but we are coming out of a lockdown. There's been a large number of measures put in place. But, you know, hopefully we are at the end of that period and we talked about it before and we hopefully will be moving back on to normal life. 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Peter? 
[PETER KYLE] : I think that response illustrates the entire lack of empathy people have. For people who are not home-owners and who are renting, struggling to get by, the sheer insecurity of people are being plunged into -- the only reason there's a transmission period is because people are going to be in court. There should be a longer period of time before this kicks in.
