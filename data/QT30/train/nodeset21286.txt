Kate Forbes[00:14:50] The first is that Labour and the Tories are two sides of the same coin in Scotland. They continuously side with the Tories, from my perspective they're willing to leave Scotland's future and key powers in a Tory government's hands, which is fatal when it comes to Scotland. But the second flaw is taking voters for granted. You cannot take voters for granted. Voters need to be respected, you need to understand why the message is not getting through. Now from my perspective again in Scotland, there are some very weighty issues and we've just seen a Labour campaign which has completely neglected to engage with those key issues, not least big ones on the constitution. So that from my perspective here in Scotland, seeing the Labour Party get its worst result, would be two of the fundamental flaws that we see at the heart of the Labour Party.
Fiona Bruce[00:15:47] So, Lisa, the last few times you appeared on this programme you were speaking from your attic, you might be wishing you were back there now. You were obviously going to expect slings and arrows from the other parties, but when you hear people in our audience who either want to vote Labour or who have voted Labour and now don't feel they can give you their vote, it must be profoundly depressing.
