Miriam Brett [00:27:30] Whether we would have nationwide in the sense of a UK-wide lockdown, the practicalities of that would be very difficult now for all four nations because we’ve all gone in different directions. I think what we need to do now is listen to the public health advice and follow what we’re asked to do there. On the point on hospitality, there’s a point being overlooked here as well, which is that hospitality -- and I say this as somebody who worked in the industry for a long time -- is an area that is very, very insecure at the best of times for workers. We have seen a lot of zero-hour contracts, a lot of precarious employment in the whole sector already. With this pandemic, as with so much of it, what it has served to do is not only create new vulnerabilities but expose fractures in our economy that already existed. The furlough scheme was mentioned there. I want to touch upon that. What we have in replacement for the furlough scheme is much better than the cliff edge that they were looking to do. It is still deeply inadequate. Parts of it cover areas in lockdown and we’re still asking people in many circumstances to make a cut to their wages. Are they getting cuts off their rent, their bills, their food? No. What I would like to see is a roll-out of the initial furlough initiative that covers not only areas in lockdown but also other areas so we can help sectors that are to remain closed for the foreseeable future. My last point on hospitality, when we emerge from this crisis we need a new deal for workers. This has exposed vulnerabilities that have existed far too long. We need to ban zero-hour contracts, root out precarious work and have a real wage for all workers in the UK.
