Fiona Bruce [00:54:09] Of course, not just doctors, we’re talking about all healthcare staff. Rocco?Rocco Forte [00:54:12] Well, it’s very peculiar this virus, and it doesn’t affect everybody in the same way. The week before I emerged with the symptoms, which was actually coincided with lockdown, I worked cheek by jowl with six senior executives in my office, because we were planning for the issues that we had to face, and none of them got the disease. In my household, which has 11 people and two children, and we were all together in it, only four people got the disease. And why didn’t the others catch it? And so, I think a lot of the modelling that’s taking place, is based on assumptions that are completely wrong. Fiona Bruce [00:55:07] It is a new disease, of course?Rocco Forte [00:55:09] Yeah, I know, well yes, but I mean, 500,000 deaths were based on a computer model, completely false assumptions. Probably…Fiona Bruce [00:55:21] Well I’m not sure that Neil Ferguson shares that view, but yes.Rocco Forte [00:55:22] …the 25,000 less deaths that we would have had if we’d locked down earlier, the same wrong assumptions have been put into the computer model, why should we believe them?
