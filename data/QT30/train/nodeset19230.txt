FIONA BRUCE [00:41:56] You have a specific question I know you wanted to ask. 
ANDY UNKNOWN [00:42:02] My hand up was to say that there’s a priority list in NHS workers, health and social care workers, etcetera. I wonder where the unpaid carers are, the unsung heroes caring for family members are in this priority list because they don’t seem to be mentioned nationally. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:42:22] Let’s find out. Are they going to be in the priority list? [DONE] 
MATT HANCOCK [00:42:26] Defining the social care workers in the -- 
FIONA BRUCE [00:42:30] These are unpaid carers. 
MATT HANCOCK [00:42:32] Yes, but my goodness, they may be unpaid but they certainly give care. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:42:36] I’m not downgrading what they do. Will they be in the first phase? 
MATT HANCOCK [00:42:42] The committee that advises me will define how broad that is. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:42:48] Would you like to see them in there? 
MATT HANCOCK [00:42:50] I would like to follow the clinical advice. I know I’m not giving an answer, but it is because it is important we follow the clinical advice. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:43:02] Ask your question.
