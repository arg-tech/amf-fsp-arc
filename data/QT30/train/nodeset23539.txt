[00:05:45] Okay, lots of hands up. The man in the glasses.

 [00:05:48] Thank you. Andy, with the greatest of respect, you're saying Sajid Javid has made these comments, but the leader of the house openly said todayâ€¦

This is Jacob Rees-Mogg we're talking about?

[00:05:58] Yes, he said that Tory MPs don't need to wear masks because you all know each other. Now I am a nurse who qualified and started at the very beginning of the pandemic, a real lived experience of what it's been like for patients and families. And also my colleagues, who have worked until they are burnt-out during this COVID crisis. But also our government aren't doing the best either, if I'm honest.

[00:06:10] You're talking, Brian, that Scotland's doing so much better, but our government, we're now having to deploy the military because of the large numbers of nursing vacancies in Scotland. 

So what is the government going to do to tackle that? We're about to come into the winter where everyone has been shielding, we've got massive amounts of colds and flu on top of COVID, and, yes, vaccines are great, but the NHS is bleeding.
