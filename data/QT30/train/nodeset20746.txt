Victor Adebowale[0:30:22] In my experience, I would not accuse the Royal Family of racism but I would expect them to lead the conferencing.Fiona Bruce[0:30:36] Sue.AudienceMember 20210318QT19[0:30:38] Thank you. What I would say is I've no idea whether the Royal Family are racist, to be honest, but the matter is that they have come across as racist. The interview with Megan and Harry, I didn't see much of it because the whole thing has been a very embarrassing fiasco. It is just that one member of their family seems to be racist. And I think we should know who.Fiona Bruce[0:31:08] Tony?AudienceMember 20210318QT20[0:31:10] Thank you very much, Fiona. I have been very privileged to meet a number of the members of the Royal Family and I would say straight out, they're absolutely not racist. If anybody took the trouble to watch the programme on the Commonwealth, it was Commonwealth Day on Monday, 8 March, we have a very diverse Commonwealth and several members of the Royal Family appeared on that programme. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that our Royal Family is not racist.Fiona Bruce[0:31:42] Dan.Dan Hodges[0:31:44] Well, I don't think they're a racist family. I think they may well be quite a dysfunctional family, although that may not be abnormal in that sense.
