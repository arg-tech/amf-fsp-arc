Richard Walker[0:09:42] No, Anna, I don't think it's right. We…I always look at this through the sort of lens of our customers, and we have a thousand shops around the UK, five million customers a week, and many of those are from the poorest communities in the UK. Some of our customers may rely on benefits to feed their families, some of our customers might only have 25 quid a week to spend on food, so in that context, you sort of understand how this removal of the 20 pound credit will affect them. Of course, at the other end of the equation, this is coming just at the wrong time. Now, I think any voter would expect their government to be fiscally prudent, but this is going to come at a time where we will see food inflation in the market – maybe we'll talk about that later – and obviously there's been a lot in the news about the rising gas prices and energy prices, so for some people, this is a choice between heating and eating, it really is that serious. The gentleman mentioned the alarming rise in food banks, there's now more food banks than branches of McDonalds in this country. We're a G7 country, how can that be right? So no, I think this is the wrong timing and I don't think it's fair.
