Chris[00:22:32]: They are. They are everyday items. Every single drop of fuel comes into Northern Ireland, unless I’m correct, they come from refineries in Great Britain. I haven’t seen any shortages at the protocol stages. No broken down cars for lack of fuel. Industry has not stopped. It is all working as far as I can see. So, yes, there are problems that need to get sorted out. How much of this is being hyped up in the same way that remarijuana said: Owe this will happen, that will happen. There will be massive queues. The only thing on these islands was the approach to the ports at the south of England when they were trying to get across to Europe and that was caused by Covid-19.

[Emma]: I would like to make a comment on behalf of small businesses. I run a business park at Mallusk. We have about Hough businesses. I speak with them day and daily. A number of them ship out to Great Britain and receive stock in from Great Britain. All of those who do are experiencing massive delays in receiving stock through or the administrative burden is proving closal for their staff. So I thought I would like to give them a voice this evening and say that the problems are very much real for our businesses in Northern Ireland, for a small business community.
