Marie van der Zyl[0:10:29]It's been an incredibly painful day. It's a damning incitement of Labour. This is really serious. The EHRC report has found that the Labour party has committed unlawful acts of harassment and victimisation against Jewish people. It doesn't get any worse than that does it? And we felt during this time people were making allegations, raising this, as Bonnie said, were smears, some kind of deliberate action, and the Jewish community, we didn't want this fight, but we had to stand up, we had to say this was wrong. We were proud to do that. And today is a damning incitement, as I've said. And what's happened during the course of the last few years is that antisemitism was on the fringes of society and it's been brought straight into mainstream politics, into the political party. Jeremy Corbyn and his leadership made a political decision to ignore, not to tackle antisemitism. That is so appalling. It's not imaginable in this day and age. The leadership did nothing about it and here we are today talking all these years later when this could have been resolved. And not only did the leadership of the party not do anything about it, we've now got findings of interference, political interference by the leader's office. It doesn't get much worse than that does it?
