Andy Burnham[0:04:02] We had another thing this week, that top business executives could escape quarantine. Some are living by some rules, others by other rules. The danger is all the discipline collapses when we need to remain vigilant.
Fiona Bruce[0:04:22] I wondered how many questions would come in on this. I suspected perhaps not that many. We had loads. Lots of hands are up now. Let's hear from some of you. Jo.
AudienceMember 20210708QT02[0:04:34] I think this is a clear example of how there are huge double standards. This was one opportunity for Boris Johnson to stand up and be counted, to show us he does have a moral compass and he takes that sort of behaviour very seriously. There is a litany of poor behaviour, poor standards in public office, to which he doesn't address. In particular, at the moment, with the acceleration of the vassal programme which they keep referring to as a huge success, which it is, I think that's a distraction from what's going on. I don't understand how the government feel that people will follow the rules now when they have a Health Secretary or ex-Health Secretary that clearly can't and won't follow the rules.
