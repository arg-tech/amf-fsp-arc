Fiona Bruce[0:00:46] We know what he said. He said he considered the matter closely.
David Davis[0:00:50] He's an ex-journalist. He knows some don't pursue the truth, they are pursuer of headlines. He knows he is talking about replacing his most important Cabinet member, really, at this point in the middle of this crisis. He knows he is talking about the fate of two families and six children, and so on. I expect what he was doing was creating time for the -- for Matt Hancock to make his own decision. That's what I suspect was going on. I don't know, but that's what I suspect. Frankly, if a Prime Minister shows some loyalty, even perhaps unwise loyalty to a subordinate, I think that's a good thing.
