Fiona Bruce[0:21:48] Have you been on the receiving end of that kind of behaviour, Sam?
AudienceMember 20210318QT17[0:21:52] Yeah, I have. I've had -- starting from, you know, whistles when you are walking past. If I finished a shift at the pub -- obviously not at the moment -- and I'm walking home at 11 o'clock in the evening and you're walking past a man who has his hood up, you're pretending to be on the phone because you're scared about his crossing the road and doing something. My 20 year old daughter is renting privately but she's due to go back to campus now and she's a bit worried because where she's going to be living on campus is right near a wooded area that she has to walk through. You know, it shouldn't be an issue. She was on the phone to me a couple of weeks ago and she said, "I'm just a bit worried because to get in and out of the campus you have to go through a wooded area and I don't fancy walking through there at nighttime." I said, you shouldn't feel like that. But unfortunately that's the case. Even with a lot of campus security, it still plays on her mind.
