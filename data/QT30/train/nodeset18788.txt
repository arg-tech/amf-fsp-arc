Steve Barclay [0:19:58] The key challenge before us is jobs. If you look at what happened going into the pandemic, we had halved the rate of unemployment amongst the young. But the young tend to be the first to feel the impacts of a recession, which is why, if you look at the figures now for the 18 to 24s, they are 10% of the working age population with 18% of welfare claimants. So they tend to feel hardest first, and are often in the sectors like hospitality, tourism, where the impacts are greater. So the strategy has been first to protect as many jobs as possible. That's why we have had the furlough scheme, which has protected over 9 million jobs. So a significant cost of over 22 billion pounds. The self-employment scheme which has protected again around 2 and a half million jobs, at a cost of 7 and a half billion, while we supported 850,000 businesses through the grants scheme, investing 10 billion pound into that. So there's been very significant measures alongside all the things we have done on cash flow to support businesses.
