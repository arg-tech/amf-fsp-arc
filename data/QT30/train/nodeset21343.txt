[00:57:33] When you referee out in Italy and Rome, they have the Italian flag, whoever they're playing against and then in the middle always on the stadium they put up the match flag of the referee, and the Welsh flag, the Welsh dragon was always hanging there when I was refereeing and I was so proud looking up at that. I don't think you should mandate the flag on anybody. You have to understand that within Wales, there are people who want to fly the Union Jack, there are people who are proud to be British, there are other people who don't feel proud to be British, and I think it's wrong to mandate the flag on people. I think it should be individual choice.
