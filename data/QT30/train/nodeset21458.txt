[ANTHONY COSTELLO] : Get the coaches on. In soccer you don't get every football player interviewed after the match. Okay, it's a team game. But we heard so much about -- we are more open about it. When you think Serena Williams, Johnny Wilkinson, Alistair Campbell, Lady Georgia, they all talk about mental health now. But if she said she injured her knee, people think nothing of it. When she says "I have a mental health problem", which is quite courageous, she should have been looked after by the sports authorities.Fiona Bruce[0:35:32] Hannah. [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : I think the press only really have themselves to blame for the fact that sports people don't want to talk to them. They have become more and more -- looking for the angle, the scoop, the story, the headline that is going to shift their article over the others. As a result they have isolated the people they are writing about. They no longer work with the sports people. They don't consider their mental health at all. They're solely focused on what they can get out of that interview. I think it should be -- it should reflect back on them and they should be limited in their access.
