James Cleverly[00:43:39] We have looked at the impact of stop and search. When I worked with Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London, we looked at how crime disproportionately affect black Londoners, and he’s carried that passion now with him into Downing Street. And it’s easy when people say, oh, you know, we should do something, and when asked what exactly we should do, you are able to give an answer, because it is not simple and it is not the kind of change that can happen overnight. But I’m incredibly proud of the work that the Prime Minister has done both as prime minister and as mayor of London to try and close the gap between the lives…the lived experience of ethnic minorities in the UK and the norm.Fiona Bruce[00:45:05] Well, we’ve got lots of hands up here so let’s hear from some of them. Marsha?Marsha[00:45:10] Can I just say, after you’ve mentioned that there’s been eight areas, I think reviews aren’t enough, it’s time now for reform. And I think we should start at least by educating children in school about black culture and black history, so that it can start there.
