Jess Phillips[0:47:32] I mean, there is some things I have quite enjoyed about it. I liked being at home a bit more. So maybe we could move Worcestshire to Birmingham post-Corona, that would be good.
Fiona Bruce[0:47:42] Good luck with that --
Jess Phillips[0:47:46] I think there's been a couple of things actually that we should keep and I think that there will be an element of creativity that comes out of this in tech sectors and how we have flexibility in our lives a bit more. So I have, for many many years, been campaigning for flexibility day one, largely for working mothers, although it would account for all working parents. And we have always been told no, you couldn't work at home, you wouldn't be getting enough done. And we have learnt that that is different now. We have learnt that we can be at productive when we are at home, if not more productive. But I also think from the prospective of somebody who cares very deeply about domestic violence and vulnerable people in their home, that for the first time people have woken up to the idea of what it would be like to be controlled and to be a prisoner in your own home. And I have seen a massive outpouring of support and care about that particular issue as well as a real love and support for some of our key workers, people that we can't actually live without. It didn't turn out to be the people who maybe were getting paid the most. It turned out to be low-paid key workers, often migrant workers. And I think that there is a kindness in the community that's been born.
