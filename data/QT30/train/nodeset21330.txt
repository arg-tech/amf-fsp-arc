Fiona Bruce[00:44:22] Do you think they're thinking that? Interesting. We'll hear from our audience. Kate.
Kate Forbes[00:44:27] Well, I think Robert has just highlighted precisely why this is a bad idea, because he's already talked about multiple new hurdles that somebody has to jump over in terms of new documentation in order to be able to vote. And over the last few decades, if not centuries, we've seen successive governments try to expand the franchise and yet this government seems to want to reduce it. The figures speak for themselves. Paul has already mentioned some of them, 3.5 million citizens don't have access to photo ID, 1.3 million people don't have a bank account. That makes mandatory voter ID a barrier to many people exercising their right to vote. And certainly, we've seen from our Scottish Parliament perspective cross-party agreement on expanding the franchise, making it easier for people to vote, whether they are refugees, prisoners or young people, and I think that should be the direction of travel for all governments, make it easier. Because ultimately, we're accountable to them and we should make sure that they are able to exercise their democratic right as easily as possible.
Fiona Bruce[00:45:30] Let me justâ€¦for a show of hands, just out of interest, from our Zoom audience here, put your hand up if you have been concerned about voter ID up until now. Okay, so we've got a couple here. Well, let's hear from you. Dave.
