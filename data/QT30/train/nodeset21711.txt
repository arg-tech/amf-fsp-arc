Fiona Bruce[0:40:28] Charming thought. I'm going to take another question from Fatima.
AudienceMember 20210708QT13[0:40:34] My question is would a Labour defeat be the final nail in the coffin for the Labour Party.
Andy Burnham[0:40:46] No. Absolutely not.
Fiona Bruce[0:40:46] You are going to say that, aren't you?
Andy Burnham[0:40:48] I am going to say that. The constituency is not what you might call a typical red wall seat where there has been a Labour majority forever. This is a seat that is more marginal.
Fiona Bruce[0:41:00] Four years ago Tracy won the party's highest ever vote. So, come on.
Andy Burnham[0:41:06] I was going to come on to say it's not that it wouldn't be serious, it would be serious. I think this is a real challenge not just for Keir Starmer and the Labour Party but the left more broadly. I want to make an important point about this, if I can. We have lived through a decade now, a decade where wealthy and privileged people on the right of politics or even the hard right of politics have posed as the friends of working class people. What they have been trying to do is divide working class communities, make them hate each other, one group to another. That very much is kind of what I see a sense of in Batly. It is almost a sense that you are in a forgotten area and you should feel resentful. The minorities are taking everything. They are taking this narrative into these places. People aren't feeling good because they have a right wing the cancer of zero contracts to spread.
