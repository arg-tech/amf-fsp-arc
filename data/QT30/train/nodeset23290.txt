[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : The public purse is being used at the moment for furlough. There is still, for instance, 35,000 air crew on furlough. So what is happening is the government are temporarily propping up things in the very short term. I'm more worried about what is happening over the much longer term. The decisions that are made now will affect in 5, 10, 15 years' time. You know what, that's way outside the life of this party. You know, this is why I've never joined a political party. [PETER KYLE] : The Collins review does say the scarring effect would be 100 billion out of our committee if we don't go forward. This is young people who want to do this. The young people are hungry for this. The barrier to them throwing themselves into all of this activity is the government itself. All the COVID recovery funding is already allocated. The decisions being made is how that money is being spent. They are choosing bricks. It should be children as well.
