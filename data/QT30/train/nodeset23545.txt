Heather McGregor[00:18:43] One and a half thousand of them are actually living on campus alongside me and we have a 24-hour app. I'm sure those of you in the audience who were students will know exactly what I mean. If anything happens, 24/7, seven days a week, you just press the app and somebody will come to you. We run a central security service that will do that. And that is the kind of thing that I think needs to happen. These venues have to take the responsibility for the people that they have on the premises. They are after all handing over money and I think that they need to exercise a duty of care.
Fiona Bruce[00:19:26] Kate, what can be done?
Kate Forbes[00:19:28] Well, I would like to think that I could classify myself as a young woman in much the same shoes as you are and I understand that fear as I think so many woman, not just in Scotland, across the UK and beyond, understand that fear. And I think from my perspective, there are three things that I would say. That, one, legislation is really important but it's never enough. You can have the legislation, but there are two other things you need. You need rigid enforcement of that legislation. And I know that Police Scotland are doing a lot of work right now to get to the bottom of those reports.
