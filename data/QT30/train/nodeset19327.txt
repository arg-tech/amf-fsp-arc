Fiona Bruce [00:07:34] Can I just ask you, the government and Jonathan Van-Tam have been saying today the aim is to get it to care homes first, but there are difficulties with this vaccine because it has to be stored at such a cold temperature so it’s not getting to care homes first. But in Scotland, the Scottish health says care home residents will have it from 14 December. What are they able to do that we can’t? 
Michelle Donelan [00:08:00] My understanding is you can’t break up -- 
Fiona Bruce [00:08:04] No, why are they able to do it and we’re not able to do it? 
Michelle Donelan [00:08:08] It is about breaking them up. That needs the approval to do that so you’re not wasting vaccines -- 
Fiona Bruce [00:08:16] That’s true for the Scottish government as well. Is what they are saying is not right or -- 
Michelle Donelan [00:08:22] I can’t speak to the exact comment. It may be they are banking on the approval coming. We said throughout for a number of weeks now that our priority is care homes and making sure we get that vaccination in there as quickly as possible. We have to do that and we will be doing it as soon as we can.
