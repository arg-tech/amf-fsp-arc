Daisy Cooper[0:21:40] We made it clear to the Government that every single leaseholder affected would have preferred for that bill to have fallen last night than for it to pass into law. This bill has now passed into law. Leaseholders who have already received enormous bills for 50, 60, 70, 000 pounds are now possibly going to receive even more bills, possibly in a matter of days! They cannot afford to pay it. They are trapped.Fiona Bruce[0:22:08] Who do you think should be paying that bill do you think the Government can put the onus on the leaseholders or the Government therefore the taxpayer who pays it?Daisy Cooper[0:22:18] I introduced the principle ten months ago. Ten months ago. For ten months, the Government has refused to come up with a system to sort this out. It's on the Government for not coming forward with the system. I support what the cladding action group is calling for which is the Government should stump up the money in the first instance to remediate and make these homes safe they are fire traps. They are death traps. It is outrageous that almost four years on from the Grenfell tragedy we think it's OK for people to live in these kind of places.
