Madeline Grant[0:35:52] Normal got us here but we don't know factually what got us here. There's lots of speculation.
Benjamin Zephaniah[0:35:58] We know what the coronavirus is. What it comes from.

Madeline Grant[0:36:04] I've not seen the data that supports that.

Fiona Bruce[0:36:06] It seems to be that it came from animals somehow.

Benjamin Zephaniah[0:36:12] Trust me. It is a wicked virus. If you could draw an evil virus of mankind, that's what you'd draw. It has claws.

Madeline Grant[0:36:24] We have to deal with what we have now. The idea of schools one minute being open, a classroom being closed, for you, imagine you go back in September, are you teaching in person, then the next week it is on Zoom for those of your students that can attend on zoom, many of them can't. The pressure it puts on families. I have three children. Every time one child gets sent home I have to change my plan. The following week is another child, and it continues. The pressure it puts on families is immense. So, knowing this could be the case and we have this situation now and there are so many children suffering, it's what can we do from today.

Benjamin Zephaniah[0:37:08] We can test. If an individual is found positive, we can send that individual home. I think we can do away with sending home whole bubbles. In families where one person is infected, another person isn't in the same family.
