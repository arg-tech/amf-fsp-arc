Matthew B [00:26:32] Why can people pile into shopping centres by the thousands but less than 100 people can sit at pub tables?[DONE] 
Fiona Bruce [00:26:40] Mathew, are you asking this from personal experience? 
Matthew B [00:26:44] Yes. You can control them in a pub whereas in shopping centres people run around wherever they want. 
Fiona Bruce [00:26:54] Do you work in a pub. 
Matthew B [00:26:54] Yes. 
Fiona Bruce [00:26:56] Are you working at the moment. 
Matthew B [00:26:58] No I’m on furlough at the moment. 
Fiona Bruce [00:27:02] I’m assuming because Bath is in Tier 2, you must be outside in a Tier 3 area? 
Matthew B [00:27:08] Just outside. Literally 200 yards my pub is from being in Tier 2.
