Fiona Bruce[0:54:08] What will we keep? What would you keep if you are going to pick one thing?
George Mpanga[0:54:14] I would keep the -- I would say upswing in general care and etiquette that we have now understanding that we're in a pandemic. Understanding that people have been endangered. I felt that person to person has been a bit more sensitivity and attentiveness in how we check on each other and protect each other, especially from some of the on-line behaviours that might affect our emotional and mental well-being.
Fiona Bruce[0:54:44] Steve?
Steve Barclay[0:54:44] I think we have a lot of good ones. For me, one Government it's the speed which we act across departments. If I look at the programme of getting food parcels to our most vulnerable as part of brought an am in of departments together. Or the way we have been able to support the homeless through this crisis, get people off the streets. We saw the Government acting in a very different way to perhaps the traditional model done by departments and I think there is a lot that comes from a pandemic where people come together with a common cause, act much more quickly. As Theo says in terms of being more data driven around where the technology is being used for the benefit of people. I think there is ways that Government can operate coming out of the pandemic where we can move much more quickly and be more data-driven.
