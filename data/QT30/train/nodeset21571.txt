[0:06:34] I think I resonate a lot of what was said there. It concerns me that 20% of our NHS and care workers are from the BAME community. The structure should have been to gain trust, work with the communities to get the vaccine rates up before we start forcing mandatory policy on them. We already have a massive shortage of staff in those areas. What does that mean? Can I do it in my employment? We have to tread carefully with this. We have a potential to lose a lot of very good people.
