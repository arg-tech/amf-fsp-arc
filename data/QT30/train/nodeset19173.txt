 Chris Philp MP[0:40:14]Well, that’s a bit of luck, because we plan to respect the Good Friday Agreement. In fact we’ve been…Fiona Bruce[0:40:18]Well, he’s concerned that you’re not, which is why I made the point…Chris Philp MP[0:40:18]Well, we’ve been…Fiona Bruce[0:40:21]…as you well know. So my point is are you concerned that if Biden wins the relationship between the British government and America might be slightly less warm?Chris Philp MP[0:40:28]No, I’m not concerned, for two reasons. Firstly, we intend to respect the Good Friday Agreement. We have been bending over backwards to respect the Good Friday Agreement for the last three or four years since the Brexit vote happened, so I’ve got no concerns at all on that front. But to make a more general point, the Conservatives in government have worked closely with Republican presidents like Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Regan. We’ve worked closely with Democrat presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, like Clinton, like Obama, and, to be fair, Labour governments in office have done the same as well. So whoever occupies the White House as the world’s leading economy, as our closest and longest standing ally we will always work closely and cooperatively with America whoever occupies that great office. I trust the American people to make their own decision. I’m not sure, Bonnie, do you have a vote, Bonnie, in this election? do you have a vote, Bonnie, in this election?Greer[0:41:12]Well, I'm an American citizen, of course I do. Chris Philp MP[0:41:15]Great.Bonnie Greer[0:41:14]And I have one here as well.Chris Philp MP[0:41:17]Okay. You’re very lucky then.Bonnie Greer[0:41:17]Let me just point out to you…Fiona Bruce[0:41:18]Briefly, Bonnie, because I do want to move on to another subject.Bonnie Greer[0:41:20]…that Nancy Pelosi, leader of the House, and she will be leader of the House on Tuesday, she ratifies the deal. So I hope you guys are right that you’re not disturbing the GFA. Joe Biden is Irish.Chris Philp MP[0:41:32]Of course.Bonnie Greer[0:41:34]Joe Biden is Irish. Joe Biden is Irish. He’s not going to play with that.Chris Philp MP[0:41:36]Well, nor are we. Nor are we.Bonnie Greer[0:41:38]Okay, good.
