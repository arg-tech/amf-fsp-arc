Steve Parish[00:39:49] When they do that, they say it’s a U-turn. They are holding their hands up and saying they’ve got it wrong and then they’re told it’s a U-turn, so then that’s not an environment that’s conducive to people making the right decisions, is it? That is the blame game, that’s exactly what it is.

Jed Mercurio[00:40:01] No, but there’s…isn’t there a difference between making a U-turn on policy and just lying? There’s a difference between those two things.

Steve Parish[00:40:07] Well, I certainly think that the information, as you just pointed out, that they’ve received from some of our institutions of science… And I’m not here to defend them blindly – everybody’s made terrible mistakes, you know, where there was a left turn to make, we took the right one on almost every occasion and we have to learn from it. But I don’t think when we look back there’ll be any one single reason, you know.

Jed Mercurio[00:40:28] Oh, you’re absolutely right, Steve, absolutely, yeah.

Steve Parish[00:40:30] And I think we have to consider that when we move forward, and that’s the most important thing is how we move forward.

Fiona Bruce[00:40:35] Okay.
