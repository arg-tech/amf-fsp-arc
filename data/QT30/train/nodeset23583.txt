Audience Member 20211028QT41 [00:52:44] Glasgow's refuse services have been severely impacted by the pandemic. Our city is currently littered with rubbish and rats. With COP26 coming, which I welcome, by the way, I just wonder, is this the right time to be showcasing our city?Fiona Bruce[00:52:59] What do you think?Audience Member 20211028QT42 [00:53:01] I think that it could be embarrassing for the city.Fiona Bruce[00:53:04] Could be embarrassing?Audience Member 20211028QT43 [00:53:06] Yeah.Fiona Bruce[00:53:06] Anas.Anas Sarwar[00:53:08] Well, we have our cleansing workers going on strike during COP26 because of the state of our streets and the cuts to cleansing services. We have our real workers going on strike because we're cutting routes here in Scotland at a time when we're trying to tell people to get out of cars and get into public transport. We had an announcement today that bus drivers in Glasgow are planning on going on strike during COP26. And this is a direct result of us saying one rhetoric on the international stage and the national stage and cutting local budgets for local people in our communities at the same time, which is completely and utterly unacceptable.
