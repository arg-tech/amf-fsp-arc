Fiona Bruce[0:01:10] We'll get underway with the first question.
Audience Member[0:01:14] Hi. Why has it taken until 15 February for the government to impose quarantine at the border. Why haven't lessons been learned from Australia who closed their border in the first wave and now have low levels of infection?
Ian Murray[0:01:34] It is a great question, a question we have been asking in Parliament for the last year. We're an island nation and most other island nations across the world did better than us because they took the decision early to stop incoming traffic. We had the South Africa strain for 50-odd days. It is only now we take the decision to close down the borders. It's too late. There was a study by Aberdeen University which showed most of the deaths happened because of the inward variants coming in to Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It seems, again, where both governments have been too slow to react.
