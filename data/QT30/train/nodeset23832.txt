Fiona Bruce[0:47:48] James?
James Cleverly[0:47:50] Well, there is of course that risk. This is why the UK's position had always been that we withdrew when certain conditions had been met, rather than to a specific date or timeline. We are going to have to work very, very closely. We're going to have to work closely with countries in the immediate vicinity around Afghanistan, and some of those countries are countries that we have a very difficult set of relationships with, including Iran, for example. But none of those countries want to see Afghanistan turn into a terrorist breeding ground. It is going to be incredibly hard work, and it will require a degree of focus and attention, but we are absolutely committed to make sure that we put in that diplomatic work in Afghanistan, and we are deeply, deeply suspicious of the promises made by the Taliban, both in Doha and most recently, but we will judge them on their actions rather than their words, and we will work with the countries in the region, both the immediate neighbours and those in the near vicinity, who also have a vested interest in Afghanistan not returning to terrorism.
