Arlene Foster[00:31:20] We all, as government ministers, will be looking back on how we took the decisions and there will be plenty of time for reflection over the coming years, but at this moment in time what we’re focusing on is saving lives, protecting hospitals, protecting the NHS, and making sure we have enough capacity in our NHS to deal with these issues. At the moment we’re at the very peak of our hospital capacity issues. It is why our health minister felt the need to ask for military assistance this week. He has asked for 110 medics to come across to give him that assistance. I think that’s the right decision. I’m pleased we have that capability to ask for that assistance in Northern Ireland when we get to that pinch point. I think we are working together in the executive. Of course, as a five-party coalition there will be bumps along the way. Every jurisdiction, every administration has had challenges, Fiona, during this crisis that we’re all facing into. But in a five-party coalition that had just very recently come back together again, I think we have worked well together and we will continue to do what is right for all of the people of Northern Ireland.
