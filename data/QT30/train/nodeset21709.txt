Madeline Grant[0:44:06] I don't think it is as simple as the government have played divide and rule and hoodwinked the working class into voting for them. I think there is a real identity crisis for the Labour Party, for many reasons. There is a broad political realignment going on. The party is very much stuck in the past. Even the fact that at the time of the great decline of manual labour and so on, yet there is still this disproportionate interest of the trade unions which led to -- probably more left wing than the public would have liked in leaders in the Labour Party. But even the language sometimes sounds like it is from the '70s, saying things like "comrades." As Andy alluded to, and he is one of the best people doing this, but his colleagues are struggling, there's a way of articulating being patriotic that sounds genuine. Many attempt it where it doesn't fit. In a way I feel bad for ear Starmer. Although there is a problem of him lacking charisma and struggling to get his message out to the general public, I think there is some time to go before the party can move past the toxic legacy of Jeremy Corbyn, which isn't something that is going to go away overnight. There was an existing identity crisis and a number of political problems. But you have to wonder what is the purpose of the Labour Party now if it no longer stands for the working classes.
