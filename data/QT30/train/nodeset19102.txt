Fiona Bruce [00:45:28] Miriam. Miriam Brett [00:45:30] I think the first point to make here is the campaign for independence hasn’t started yet. Westminster is making the campaign in and of itself. It is increasing appetite for independence by virtue of the actions it has taken. I’m not surprised to see a growing appetite for independence. We have had a multitude of factors. There’s not any one single factor that increased the support for independence. I think there has been a multiple attitude of things. It is important to bear in mind where we were prior to this. We faced a decade of austerity from a government we didn’t vote for. We saw things pushed through by another government we didn’t vote for backed by billionaire financiers. When Scotland voted to remain, it didn’t make an ounce of difference. Now we see the pushing through of the internal market Bill. To quote Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister that this is an enormous power grab, and we’re seeing a shoring up, a concentration of powers in Westminster from devolved -- that matters most now because what that does is set the standards going forward for goods and services. That’s important because we are heading into trade deals. I’d argue it is not going to be the UK government setting the standards; it is probably going to be the US and whoever our future trade deals are with and we are going to see a race to the bottom and I think it is eminently clear that areas like our NHS will be on the table. We have already seen concerns from farmers, from environmental campaigners and unions about what the prospect of that might be.
