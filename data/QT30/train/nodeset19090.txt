Audience Speaker [00:36:04] Like many people, I’m really surprised that when Rishi Sunac made this announcement back in March to put his arms around everybody and support us that this would suddenly stop, which feels like it is about to happen. If we were at war, we’d have a war chest and it would be continuing. You wouldn’t give up after 7 months. I feel the government went into one gear and are totally shifting into another one now. It looks bleak for a lot of people in different sectors of different economies, different areas, different parts of the country. Audience Speaker [00:36:44] About the job safety scheme Rishi Sunac said that universal credit is a safety net for those whose income has dropped, he proposed cuts to universal credit. This is going to cost 6 million households, with the bottom percent losing most of their income. This is terrible economics. He has taken 6 billion out of the economy by cutting benefits, that’s over 6 billion of cash being spent in a consumer-driven economy. As usual, the poor are paying the cost of it.
