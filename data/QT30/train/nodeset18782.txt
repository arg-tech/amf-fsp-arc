George Mpanga[0:16:06] Even as late as April, I think the Government was denying that there was a significant risk to care facilities and by mid-May 40% of Covid-related deaths had come from care homes. So, I think it would go a long way if your Government began to show a little bit of contrition and acknowledgment of the mistakes that have been made in the handling of this crisis up to this point, as opposed to the nit-picking and the point-arguing that we have seen on Twitter, very strangely, from this Government in particular.
Jess Phillips[0:16:46] I mean, I agree with lots of that, and part of the problem with the communication that I certainly have found as a constituency PM, let alone a citizen with children out of school, is that the Government would stand in front us and say things like we have put a protective ring around care homes, and I felt at times like I was going mad, because I was talking to my care homes and hearing the reality on the ground.
