Fiona Bruce[00:50:29] What can be done in the short to medium term?
Heather McGregor[00:50:31] In the shorter time, I think that there will almost certainly have to be an approach by our members of parliament and our members of Scottish Parliament that triages things in the same way that GP surgeries do and there will have to be some element of screening. But what I would say is, this was a tragedy, it was a tragedy for Sir David, for his family, it was a tragedy for the people of Southend. We don't want an equivalent tragedy, which is that we let terrorism win by standing between our elected members of parliament and members of Scottish parliament and the people that they represent. I'm represented in parliament by Christine Jardine, I am represented in the Scottish parliament by Gordon McDonald. I have never met either of them but I would like to think that if I wanted to I could. And the thought that that might not be possible I think is tremendously sad. We don't want to heap a tragedy on another tragedy.
