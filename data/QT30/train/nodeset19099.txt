Part 36
Fiona Bruce [00:44:22] How much responsibility do you think the Westminster government has to play in the support for union here. 
David Ross [00:44:26] Iâ€™ve said in my speech to party embassy -- 
Fiona Bruce [00:44:30] For independence, I said union. 
David Ross [00:44:32] I knew where you were going with. I said to party members we need to do far more. All of us do, all of us who believe in the union have to work far harder to promote that case of what Scotland gets from the union. 
Fiona Bruce [00:44:44] Have you spoken to the prime minister about it? 
David Ross [00:44:48] I have. I have spoken to the prime minister, to MPs, to previous MPs and politicians from respective governments. It is something, since when we had the referendum in Scotland that voted for the Scottish Parliament to be reestablished and since devolution in 1999 I think there has been a feeling in London by successive UK governments of devolving and forgetting. That disinterest only aids the nationalist cause. For me, there are so many things to be passionate about for the union, what we should be fighting for. That argument is as strong today as 6 years ago when we had the referendum in 2014.
