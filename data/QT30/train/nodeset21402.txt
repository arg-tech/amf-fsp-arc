Fiona Bruce[00:32:43] Okay. And, Fatima, you asked this question, what's your view?
Fatima Bhula[00:32:47] Well, I think while so ever the actual trains are being run by numerous companies with different ways of running and different innovations, I'm not really optimistic at all. I'm in the north and we had the Northern Rail fiasco for years and years. Pre-pandemic I used to travel all over the country, hundreds of miles a week using many different operators and it was just a nightmare, and I don't see it getting any better whilst so ever we've got different companies. So I think, yeah, public ownership is the only way.
Fiona Bruce[00:33:20] Okay. Christina.
Christina Unknown[00:33:22] I live in the North East and one of the things that we noticed is that there was tremendous service offered by GNER, but when it came to reallocating the franchise the franchise was taken away from them, even though the customer satisfaction was very high, and since then it's just been worse and worse and worse. Now, yes, the government makes money out of franchises, but when they accept a bidder they shouldn't just be looking at the highest offer, they should actually be looking at how the previous franchisee has handled things. And if, as in the case of GNER, you have somebody who's doing a really good job, they should be automatically in prime position for a renewal of that franchise. Unless there is some reason why they've failed or they don't want to do it…
Fiona Bruce[00:34:26] Okay. We…
Christina Unknown[00:34:27] …they should be given that opportunity, and then you wouldn't need to nationalise.
