Fiona Bruce[0:28:36] Victor, the Royal Family very much not a racist family, do you agree?
Victor Adebowale[0:28:48] I would be gobsmacked if he responded to that in the positive. My experience of them is they're probably not, but the issue --
Fiona Bruce[0:29:00] That's not a ringing endorsement, Victor.
Victor Adebowale[0:29:06] I think the point is, as Steve said, we're all learning. The Royal Family are on the same journey. The difference between the Royal Family, though, is the Queen is the head of State. So what we need to do is look to the Royal Family and the Queen has made a start that there are issues that need to be thought about. What we really need to do is for the Queen to help the country actually have a conversation about its relationship with race. The NHS confederation established the observatory on race and health because we know that black people suffer worse services and worse outcomes in the NHS. I did a piece of work for the Metropolitan Police in 2012 that showed black people with mental health challenges have a much increased chance of dying as a result of the police handling their case. So, these are systemic issues, I'm afraid, and the Royal Family are part of the system. So they need to lead the learning.
