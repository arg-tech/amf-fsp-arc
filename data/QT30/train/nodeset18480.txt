Fiona Bruce [00:29:41] So you’re opposing the quarantine as well?
Rocco Forte [00:29:43] Yes, of course. Yeah, I mean the quarantine, again, it’s got no scientific evidence behind it. The chief scientific officer says it’s a political decision, not a scientific decision. We’re closing down, and the rest of Europe is opening up. Until Sunday you could come from Iran or Brazil, the two highest hotbeds of the disease, with impunity, and all of a sudden on Sunday evening, no one could come in.
Fiona Bruce [00:30:10] So, can I just ask you, so with your hotels in other countries where the distancing is a metre or one and a half metres, can you open economically, profitably, with that kind of social distancing?
Rocco Forte [00:30:21] It’s still difficult, but a metre makes it possible. I mean, the tourism industry has suffered disproportionately, effectively it’s been without income since March, and will continue to be without income in this country until July, so that’s four months, a third of the year, and many, many businesses in the tourism industry will go under. You impose quarantine which stops foreigners coming into this country, just when there was a chance to save something out of the summer season, it’s another nail in the coffin, a two metre rule makes it impossible for the people to open properly.
