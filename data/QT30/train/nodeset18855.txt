Lisa Nandy[00:22:25] Well, it’s welcome that they’re not trying to force schools to reopen when it’s not safe to do so. And actually, this is why months ago we were calling for the government to have an exit strategy from lockdown and to start working on that now, because the countries that have managed to get children back to school more quickly were planning for this several months ago. They’ve also done a lot more to try and get support to children in the meantime so that when children do go back to school, we’re not dealing with this enormous attainment gap. The government promised laptops and internet connections months ago but we’re just still not seeing them delivered around the country.
We had a plan announced today that said that there’d be private tutoring available. Now, I really welcome this, but once again, school leaders have been left wringing their hands, saying, why haven’t you spoken to us before you announce these plans? We’ve had enough of back-of-the-envelope plans; we need a proper national strategy and a national consensus; we need the government to reach out and work with schools in order to get children back to school as quickly as possible
