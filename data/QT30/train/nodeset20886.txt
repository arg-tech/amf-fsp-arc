Fiona Bruce[00:41:11] Well, we've got two young people in our audience who've got their hands up. Tim, let's start with you. Are you more likely to vote Labour? Do you think this is a good idea? 
Tim Unknown[00:41:18] I'd always say increasing suffrage is always a good idea. As a democracy we want to get as many people heard as possible. My suspicion would be that by reducing the age, the populous might be more likely to vote on populist ideas, so I wonder if that would actually benefit parties such as Plaid in the Senedd elections more than Labour, because, as we've seen recently, Labour is in record lows in polls. 
Fiona Bruce[00:41:48] Katie? Or Kate, sorry? 
Kate Unknown[00:41:51] Yes, I think the thing with 16 and 17-year-olds is I think we just don't give them enough credit and I think that, like, I'm 27, I've only really spent the last few years learning about all of this. When I was 16, I didn't take an interest, but I know, like, the 16, 17, 18-year-olds that I work with who know more than I ever knew at that age, and I think that it's their future more than it's my future, more than it's the next future, do you know what I mean? And I think they have every right to have a say in that as an 18-year-old would.
