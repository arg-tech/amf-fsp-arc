I know there has been some repayment made from -- is it Manchester University has made some accommodation. Fiona Bruce [00:55:14] Yes, for accommodation, not for teaching. [DONE] Sarah Jones [00:55:18] Other universities are looking at some of those things. I think the government should look at that as well and see whether there’s support they can give.

Sarah Jones [00:55:38] That’s what we need to look at. There will have been different experiences for different students. It will be a different experience depending what university you’re at and what you do. Liam Halligan [00:55:50] I did two degrees. Most people that taught me were under 40.
