DANIEL UNKNOWN [01:05:40] Is it a matter of adding new legislation or becoming a less judgmental society? 

MATT HANCOCK [01:05:46] I admire you so much, Rosie, for the way that you articulate this. I thought what Emily said was so strong, in a small way I have -- I am neuro-diverse, I’m dyslexic. It took me until I was 18 until I was diagnosed. Then I got the support I needed and it made an enormous difference to me. But I was lucky because I was able to get by on my maths and my -- despite the fact that my language skills were very poor, my written language skills, at school. So I felt just a tiny bit of what that feels like. But I think that Daniel’s point is just so important, which is, of course of course legislation is important and that is something we should always be pushing forward, like the change of the buses at the end of this year. I didn’t know about that. It is really important. But how long has it taken us to get to that point. But it is about society accepting everyone and looking for the good in everyone. I think that everyone has something to contribute and we need to go and it is our task, our mission is to go and find what is good in people the contribution they can make and bring it out and support people to do that. So I think there’s a long way to go
