FIONA BRUCE [00:16:52] Is this a particular concern for you, John? Is that why you asked the question. 
Audience Speaker [00:17:02] I asked the question because I’m probably the oldest person here in the whole audience, but I would be one of those down the line to be affected. I would not be in the first tranche but I’m well over 70 now so I would be fairly close to that. I personally, I’ve heard quite a few people are concerned about having the vaccine, but I wouldn’t hesitate to have it because I know a lot of people are very scared at the moment. Simple as that. [DONE]
FIONA BRUCE [00:17:30] Rosie, is it clear to you when someone in your situation might get the vaccine? 
ROSIE JONES [00:17:36] No, not really. I know you mention care workers and what about people who still need to work? What about teachers? What about people who work in supermarkets? Where in the line do they come?
