Part 22
Fiona Bruce [00:26:30] Miriam, this is a two-part question from Martin and our audience has thrown in their ten penneth as well. When is a café a restaurant, a restaurant a bar? That affects whether they can open or not. Also the fact it is different in the four nations, do you think it should be one message? 
Miriam Brett [00:26:52] Just now -- well, firstly, there has been confusion about what constitutes as a café and a bar. We have seen that elsewhere in the UK. 
Fiona Bruce [00:27:02] We are hearing Robert Jenrick in the UK government Cabinet saying if you are going to eat food in a restaurant or in a café in the UK, in certain parts of the UK now or in a pub, rather, that they have to serve a substantial meal. Could it be a pasty? It could be if it had a side salad. If we’re dealing with that level of complexity, it is difficult to navigate.
