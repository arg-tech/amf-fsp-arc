Fiona Bruce[00:01:10] Our first question tonight is from Blair Wondin.
Blair Unknown[00:01:22] Hello. If the main Scottish elections return a full independence government, what moral and legal right does the Westminster government have to deny another independence referendum?
Fiona Bruce[00:01:32] Doug?
Douglas Ross[00:01:33] Well, I want to stop a pro-independence majority government, I want to stop the SNP having a majority at this election, as the Scottish Conservatives did five years ago. It was by people uniting behind the Scottish Conservatives that stopped that SNP majority in 2016, and people can do that again at this election.
