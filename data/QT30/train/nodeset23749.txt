Fiona Bruce[0:49:45] So 56 per cent is about right, that's what the head of the Royal College is saying. Richard, does that sound right to you?
Richard Walker[0:49:51] Well, you know, speaking as a patient at times myself, and Iâ€¦we referenced earlier in the show that my frontline colleagues haven't had the option of being able to work from home. It doesn't feel to me as a patient right, really quite nervous, about the lack of face to face contacts with GPs, and therefore missing the nuances, you know, the small things that potentially you can only get from a face to face consultation. Now, GPs are under enormous workload, but these are the terms of the job that they signed up for, and maybe a balance is now available where there's things like the pill, for example, which you still have to have a GP's appointment for, which seems a bit ridiculous to have to actually visit the GP, but all it does, the GPs are the gatekeepers for the NHS, and actually I've done this myself. When I can't get a GP's appointment, I've gone to A and E. Now, what pressure does that put under our NHS, it's not right, and therefore I think they should work face to face wherever possible.
