Clarity is something that people demand from government. And whilst it’s
right of us to consider the evidence and to constantly evaluate and question
and make adjustments, the two metre rule certainly stays for the foreseeable.
 I think with regard to the other measures…

It’s confusing though isn’t it, given that some countries are going for a
metre, the WHO is suggesting a metre, and then you’ve got other countries that
are going for one and a half metre, people are wondering, where’s the…it’s all
one science, so how is that decision made?

Buckland [00:36:24] I think, Fiona, it’s a question of two stages; the
evidence and the advice you get from SAGE and the scientists forms part of a
decision making, that is ultimately political, the two stage approach to
it. And there will be a number of different factors in that. I think
the challenge for government now, as we come out of this period of really
intense lockdown, is how to get the combination right. And that’s why
there’s been a big debate about the quarantine. Clearly at the time of the
height of the outbreak, quarantine would have made no difference, but now, the
advice that we get, is that even small adjustments can affect that R rate, and
therefore it’s a constant evaluation to see what adjustments we can make, to
help people in Rosina’s position, and to get the balance right between the need
to open up, but the need to save lives as well.
