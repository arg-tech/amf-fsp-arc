Fiona Bruce [00:28:31] So hang on, you've just said that Dominic Raab made unhelpful comments, what are you referring to in particular?
Vaughan Gething[00:28:34] I think when he's been talking about comments about the situation with Europe and it's the tone of what's said, and it's the tone that matters in all this, that's why everyone needs to take a step back and calm down, because actually we've got a real success story on our hands with effective vaccines being produced, we're going really quickly in Wales and the rest of the UK and that's what we all need to focus on. 
Adam Price[00:28:52] The Foreign Secretary referred to the EU as acting like a dictatorship, I mean, you know, if that isn't inflammatory language then what is? It doesn't help anyone talking like that. 
Claire Fox[00:29:01] They should stop acting like a dictatorship then. 
Adam Price[00:29:03] Oh, here we go again. 
Vaughan Gething[00:29:04] And you see, that's the problem, if that's the discourse we have, that helps no one. And that will make people frightened, that is scaremongering, that's really unhelpful and it's in all of our interests to go as quickly as possibleâ€¦
