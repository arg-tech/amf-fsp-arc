AudienceMember 20210318QT22[0:38:46] So the answer, and my point that I would make, is I don't really know about whether the Royal Family are racist because, as I say, the evidence to me was confused. But I can say with some certainty, having seen the headlines, that the British tabloid press, the red tops, is. And that, I think, is the issue here.Fiona Bruce[0:39:10] Dan, you're up.Dan Hodges[0:39:12] Funny, that. There's a couple of issues. Firstly, and this is the elephant rampaging around the last couple of days --Fiona Bruce[0:39:22] When you say the elephant in the room, it's not people have not been discussing it.Dan Hodges[0:39:28] As you're aware, there's been a specific debate about racism in the press as a result of this. Let's be clear about this. There is racism in the British media. There are racists in the British media. There is subconscious racism in the British media and there is institutional racism in the British media.Bonnie Greer[0:39:48] Are you saying that yourself? The things you just said. You're not quoting someone, you're saying that yourself.Dan Hodges[0:39:58] I'm saying we need to acknowledge that.Fiona Bruce[0:40:02] At your own paper?Dan Hodges[0:40:04] I'll be honest with you, I can't say that I have experienced or seen any racism at my own paper.Fiona Bruce[0:40:10] In terms of the coverage?Dan Hodges[0:40:14] No. No. I completely disagree with the idea the coverage has been racist but I'm not going to sit here and pretend racism doesn't exist in the British media. That would be ridiculous.
