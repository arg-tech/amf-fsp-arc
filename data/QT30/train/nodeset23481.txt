[0:27:20] There may be an argument to say look again at this process. But the idea that you would do that under a live case is just -- it is just unacceptable. I sat on the committee that Andrew Ledson chaired looking at the issue of sexual harassment in Parliament and what processes you would need for that. It took us a year of painstaking cross-party work to come up with a new system, a better system. That's the kind of legwork that you had to put in. The idea that Jacob Reese Mogg could rock up in Parliament yesterday and say here's a new committee when putting the tories in the driving seat was never going to work. We need the long-term process to get the better rules in place. The last thing I wanted to say to Tim was about this being a case of Boris Johnson showing decency, there is a case that Boris Johnson was thinking about his own skin because he knows the commissioner is likely to be looking at him again, about his flat. So he's actually got bad blood with this committee. For him to be promoting a process that would say she will be pushed out of her role in order for him to be able to carry on with his lackadaisical business as usual --
