[00:49:48] I would disagree with that. I do have a very vested interest in ensuring that the UK delivers for Scotland. But on this I agree with Douglas in his maiden speech a few weeks ago where he stated that his Conservative bosses don’t care about Scotland. That is the bottom line and that is why we’re seeing an increase in the polls. The polls are indicative of public opinion, but we had the 9th conservative poll showing support for independence.

[00:50:18] Do you think the falling out between Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond has been helpful?
Kate Forbes
[00:50:26] More people are interested in suppressing the virus and making decisions about their long-term future because they can see -- the polls prove this point -- they can see that Scotland’s best interests are served by a Scottish government. The question for me is what is the democratic route to delivering that. That is a question I would pose to the Conservatives. It is unsustainable and it is undemocratic to keep saying no. We have to have a consistent increase in the polls. We have another poll yesterday saying that two-thirds of people in Scotland think that there should be another referendum in the next five years years.
