[0:41:06] In view of his public denial, should Prince Andrew go to the States and face his accuser in court?

Fiona Bruce
[0:41:12] Right. Now, let's just get the facts here. Virginia Giuffre, an American woman, has accused Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her three times in the States when she was underage there, which was 17. Prince Andrew denies it. He doesn't recall meeting her and there is a legal process going on here which we have to be aware of. Ian, I know from when you submitted this question...

AudienceMember 20211014QT31
[0:41:38] Say that again.

Fiona Bruce
[0:41:38] I know when you submitted this question, you are a former police criminal investigator.

AudienceMember 20211014QT32
[0:41:44] I'm a retired criminal investigator.

Fiona Bruce
[0:41:48] What's your view with that background?

AudienceMember 20211014QT33
[0:41:52] It depends whether he has told the truth really.

Fiona Bruce
[0:41:56] He says he has.

AudienceMember 20211014QT34
[0:41:58] If I was in his position, if I was telling the truth I'd want to go and see what corroborative evidence there is for this because in my line of work that I used to do, we would normally be looking for some corroborative evidence of an offence such as DNA or CCTV or independent witnesses. That kind of thing.

Fiona Bruce
[0:42:20] You think he should go to the States?

AudienceMember 20211014QT35
[0:42:22] Well, yes, I do.

Fiona Bruce
[0:42:26] Nick, your view?

Nick Ferrari
[0:42:32] Because I don't fancy a night in the Tower, I hear what you say, Ian. This is how I'm going to sum it up. The Queen has been through the most trying period of her life, I would imagine, not that long ago, she lost her consort of goodness knows how many decades. She has also got the issues of one of her grandsons living in California. It is a as this woman continues to serve that she is blighted by problems such as this.
