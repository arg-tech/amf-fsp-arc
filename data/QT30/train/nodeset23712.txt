[0:11:52] Do I think it's fair on the disabled woman who contacted me, who said, I'm being told by the Conservative government, just go out and work more hours, like this young lady said in the audience, she said, I desperately want to work, but I can't because of my physical and mental health conditions, how am I going to get by, as others have said, we've seen energy prices going up, food prices are already going through the roof, and many of these people, because a lot of people on universal credit are working, will also be hit by the national insurance rise that's coming in in April next year. 

I mean, the average nurse in the NHS is going to be paying 315 pounds more in her tax, so no, I don't think it's fair. I think it needs to be maintained, I think it's cruel and it's callous, and I think Grant knows that, because there've been plenty of his own backbenchers who have also been saying that it needs to be kept, so when Kate says we need a debate, actually we've had quite a lot of debates, and there are people in all the parties across the House of Commons who are saying, you have to maintain this, otherwise we are going to be plunging people into destitution and poverty, and as somebody in the audience said, in a G7 country, it is utterly unacceptable.
