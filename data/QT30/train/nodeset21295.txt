[00:16:55] In the end what we desperately want to do as a Labour Party is to show that all those things that Andy Burnham is delivering in Greater Manchester, that Marvin Rees is delivering in Bristol, that Siddique Khan is delivering in London and Mark Drakeford is delivering in Wales can be a reality for people in this country. Opportunities for young people, good jobs so you don't have to get out and…

[00:17:19] And is that, do you think, by…

[00:17:21] And not just levelling up places, but levelling up the people in them.

Fiona Bruce
[00:17:25] And do you think that is by forming some kind of alliance, formally or informally, as your former leader Tony Blair has suggested, with the Lib Dems, with the Greens.

[00:17:34] Look, I haven't read the Tony Blair piece, I haven't read many of these pieces, because I'm not so much interested in what the Labour Party deconstructs or doesn't deconstruct, I'm interested in the country and how we fix the very many problems in this country after 11 years of Tory government. And I would just say that at the end of the day I will work with whoever it takes to deliver change for my community and for my country, whether that's the Conservative Party or progressive parties as well. But there is no substitute for winning the argument and winning back people's trust. And that's what you've heard tonight and that is exactly what we in the Labour Party are going to set out to do.
