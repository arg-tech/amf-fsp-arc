Grant Shapps[0:34:02] I think all the points have been very well made. What we are going to do is have a look at this and come forward with some recommendations about how it can practically work. What we can say, the more people we can get vaccinated, the better. The one thing we'd all agree on this evening is the speed of the vaccination programme has been tremendous. There's no country in Europe who are anywhere close to the speed -- one of the amazing -- one of the things we're going to have to think about, talking about international travel, is what happens if we are largely vaccinated by the summer, for example, but the places people want to go to are not vaccinated. Another can of worms. So, there are all sorts of questions which is why we set up two task forces, one that Michael Gove will run on the domestic side, and one international which I will run.
