[FIONA BRUCE] : Peter, from a Labour perspective do you want 21 June delayed or do you want to press ahead with easing restrictions on that day? 
[PETER KYLE] : It should be following the data, not the date. I think Anthony is right on that. 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Abbott any would like to 
[PETER KYLE] : He is saying what he thinks the data currently says. We need to get closer to the point. It was wrong to call it freedom day and signpost it so far in advance because we should have been seeing how the data -- focus on getting that down. The Labour Party has been constructive on this. We said months ago everybody who comes into the country should be hotel-isolated so we can properly isolate and suppress the virus. Only 1 percent of them still are to this day. That's irresponsible. We said that people who are forced to isolate should be given more support. At the moment only 10 percent of people who are asked to isolate are isolating. I have real sympathy with Andrea's point. Where we get this right as a country is where the messaging is crystal clear based on scientific advice we all understand.
