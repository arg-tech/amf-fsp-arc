If you haven't had the first jab, you haven't had the second jab, or you're entitled to the booster, please get it. And if you know a friend or a family member who's maybe reading something online about how the vaccine is harmful to their health, please have a word with them. Encourage them that the best way that they can protect themselves and their friends and family is to go out and get the vaccine.
