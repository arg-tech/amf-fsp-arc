DAVID LAMMY [00:29:10] I’m sorry, Matt, but it is a bit facile when you say things like “yes, we can.” The point is we heard there have been problems getting out the flu vaccine this year, and we still have to do more, obviously, because flu runs with us right into the spring. We know that you blew 500 billion on PPE that didn’t work. We know that it’s now nine months and 12 days since the first infection in York and we still, in the sixth richest economy in the world, have not got a successful test, track and trace system. So, in the end this is about public confidence. We need people to believe and to take the vaccine, but I think you’re being asked can you do it given that these freezers, you know -70, are necessary to get this distributed. You can understand why people are nervous that we’re going to be well into the summer before this vaccine is properly rolled out.[DONE]
MATT HANCOCK [00:30:06] All I’d say is it’s not can I do it, it’s can we do it. This is something that we as a nation need to do together. With the NHS, obviously, in the lead.
FIONA BRUCE [00:30:18] Hang on a minute, that’s all very well --
