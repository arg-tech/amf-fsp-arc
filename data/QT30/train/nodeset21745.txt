Andy Burnham[0:52:08] It is not now. I will serve a full second term to the people of with him the Westminster. I want Kier to succeed. I agree with David, the representation has not been what it should be in parts of the country, that was one of the reasons we lost Scotland. But I agree with Benjamin because we do need a new way of doing things. The new way of doing things is what I'm doing in Manchester, what Steve Rotherham is building in liberalism. What we are building as a first rather than party first. It is a big change to the way things are done. Westminster is party first. People switch off from it. We come at it in a different way. It is bottom up, we had a drive until Greater Manchester to end homelessness, rough sleeping, we involved people from all sectors, and it is empowering we made a re change. That is a different way of doing things. I'm beginning to kind of roll back the '80s a little, putting buses back under public control in Greater Manchester. We are building zero carbon homes.
