Fiona Bruce [00:42:48] Another question from Colin Campbell. Audience Speaker [00:42:54] A recent poll shows that Scottish independence has a huge majority of 58 percent support. How long can the UK government continue to deny the Scottish people the right to have their say on their future? Fiona Bruce [00:43:08] David, you said before that London is, in part, responsible for the support for independence in Scotland. Do you want to expand on that? David Ross [00:43:18] Just to answer the question. I don’t downplay the challenge that we face. Those of us in Scotland like me who believe in the union, who believe in Scotland’s proud place, has part of four nations of the United Kingdom. But I also don’t believe there’s anything inevitable about this, despite what the SNP representatives might say on this panel because I think Scotland’s best and proudest days are when we stand together as part of a union we helped to build. But I look at this from a permanent point of view. I have a wee 18 month old son, and I look at him and when I see these polls I don’t get downhearted, I get more determined than ever before to ensure that when he grows up he can be as proud a Scott and as proud a Brit as me, but he can grow up in a United Kingdom rather than a divided Scotland. Those of us who believe in the union, who will fight for the union have to work harder and better than ever before to promote what Scotland gets from the union and what it gives to the union.
