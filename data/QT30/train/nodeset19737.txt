Susan Desouza [00:06:04] Thank you. Could I just make two points. Firstly, Israel have been deploying out the Pfizer vaccine. They had all the logistic issues we have, but they managed to roll out a million vaccines in 12 days. The second point, you mentioned about the 12-week gap between the first and second dose for Pfizer. The World Health Organisation yesterday were very clear that they reckoned that -- well, they stated that it should be between 21 and 28 days maximum gap between the first and second dose and, in exceptional circumstances, up to 6 weeks. This is a really, really important point. I’ve had five friends of mine contacting me today specifically worried about why we are not following the World Health Organisation rules and advice and Pfizer’s advice as well. Fiona Bruce [00:07:06] Shall I come to Mark on that.
