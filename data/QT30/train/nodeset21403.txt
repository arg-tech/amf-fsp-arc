[00:34:31] Okay. We hear your point there, Christina. Nadhim, isn't this one Conservative government putting right something that was done wrong by a previous Conservative government under John Major? He was the one obviously that created the franchises, created Network Rail, et cetera, which Grant Shapps today is saying just doesn't work?

Nadhim Zahawi
[00:34:45] Well, no. I think what Grant is saying is we've got to learn and improve. So you look at, say, Transport for London, TFL, you've got the Underground, you've got the over ground run by a different company, you've got Docklands is a private company. So you can have a system that can be better integrated under Great British Railways, and the bit of it that I think everyone should be looking forward to is 21 June there'll be flexible travel which will hopefully save consumers moneyâ€¦

Fiona Bruce
[00:35:18] You mean flexible season tickets?

Nadhim Zahawi
[00:35:18] Absolutely. So that is a real strength of being able to, as Harriet said, listen to the commuters, listen to people who are using railways and come up with what I think is a better system that keeps the innovation but also integrates it and delivers a better service and a better outcome for all of us that are using the railways.
