Holly[0:39:02] This seems like a typical Conservative: The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This shouldn't be something that is secondly thought about. These are people who require houses. This is one of the number-one priorities, and unfortunately with Covid, it's just gotten worse. So, stop promising us X, Y and Z and actually deliver housing.
Suresh[0:39:32] I welcome the demand being put on the Government in terms of investment in the youth and social housing and things such as that but I come to the point that I made at the beginning, and I agree with Theo, to do and fulfil those demands what we need to be doing is making sure the economy is restarted in a proportionate and a sensible way. I think there's been a lot of unfair criticism to the Government on -- by some of the panelists here and some of the other viewers. I think they should be applauded for the furlough scheme they have done. This is an unprecedented situation. The only way they can invest more is if they can get the economy going.
