FIONA BRUCE [00:46:24] You are involved in developing a vaccine as well at Imperial College London. ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:46:28] We are one of the two UK teams developing a vaccine. FIONA BRUCE [00:46:32] Are you getting funding from the government? ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:46:36] We are getting government. But it still requires a huge effort for us to build a technology from scratch. To give the kind of examples of the competition, there are 30 R&amp;A companies around the world. FIONA BRUCE [00:46:48] This is the particular technology that Pfizer used. ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:46:52] It is a new technology that’s at a tipping point. Our direct competition are two companies in Germany, one of which is BioNTech, they got grants from the German government of 350,000,250 million apiece, even though they are well-funded. So we need to think in terms of the strategy as to how we’re going to nurture the vaccine industry, which is more than just start-up, that is sustainable and has a long-term strategic plan.[DONE] FIONA BRUCE [00:47:24] Are you getting those kind of funds from the secretary for health here? ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:47:30] We are getting support and we fully anticipate that the government will want to see the two flagship programmes are supported to the hilt. FIONA BRUCE [00:47:44] Daniel.
