Fiona Bruce[0:55:30] Taking your Government hat off for a minute, on a personal level, what would you keep?
Steve Barclay[0:55:34] As someone with two children under ten, I think actually seeing more of the family at home working, I think all of us in apartment spend a lot of time away from home. So I think actually that aspect is something that I have really enjoyed and I think of us, the flexibility around that would be great to
Fiona Bruce[0:55:54] On an entirely frivolous note I have to say the one thing I can look forward to is not having to queue at the bar in the pub or -- because if you can sit at the table and summon someone to bring you a drink I think it will be marvellous. We have got a couple of hands. Just very quickly, Niamh.
Niamh[0:56:10] I think one thing that would be really poor to come out during this time, women in abusive homes and members of the LGBTQ community and unsafe housing and mental health issues and one thing to really keep I think is the appreciation of key workers and essential workers. Health workers in particular. And I hope that's something that people won't forget about and I hope we won't get back to the point where we're clapping when we're giving nursing -- when we're denying nurses pay rises. Instead, we're clapping in appreciation.
Holly[0:56:46] I absolutely agree with George. I think we could keep kind of kindness and appreciation for our frontline team, as I have said before. But also, why don't we, as a nation, be a little bit less materialistic? I don't think a lot of people have wanted to go on fancy holidays or drive fancy cars. You have probably just wanted to cuddle a loved one. So I think we need to keep those values in our society.
