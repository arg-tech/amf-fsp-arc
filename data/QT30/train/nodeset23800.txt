Nelufar Hedayat[0:03:48] We're back in that frame now, and this foolhardy attempt at withdrawing a troop - an offensive that could have been stopped by the Taliban does not need more troops on the ground, but it needs a commitment from the Western forces, and that is what we've been lacking.
Fiona Bruce[0:04:04] You have family there still. What are you hearing from family and friends?
Nelufar Hedayat[0:04:08] These aren't just spaces we see on TV when we're watching the News at 10. These are my Fry and friends.
