Lisa Nandy[00:55:58]â€¦the first person I hug is not going to be one of the panellists, I can tell you after a year of not being able to do it. I guess I would just say I can't wait like everybody else, like Kate and everyone else, to be able to hug, not side hugs, proper hugs. But I think this Indian variant is a real problem and I agree with Robert that we've got to come through this together. People have made huge sacrifices so far and we've got to make sure that we get this right.
