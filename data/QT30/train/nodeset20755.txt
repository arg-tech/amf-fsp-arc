Fiona Bruce[0:31:56] It is extraordinary in that you feel Prince William feels he has to -- a journalist can shout to Prince William is the Royal Family racist. You can't imagine that question happening before the interview.
Dan Hodges[0:32:10] No, the reason why that is happening is because, in my view, Prince Harry and Megan have decided to take this psycho drama playing out within their family and hurled it on to the bonfire for reasons of their personal PR reasons, hurled it on to the bonfire of our raging impact law. Where are we this evening? The reality is we have a situation where we are told the Royal Family is facing the greatest crisis for 80 years, Britain's reputation has been trashed and we're told the country is fracturing down racial and generalisational lines. Some of that may be slightly overhyped. But the reality, given everything else going on, we all need this like we need a hole in the head. Harry and Megan's cheerleaders have been running around telling us all we have to pick a side, we have to pick a side. I think people will pick a side.
