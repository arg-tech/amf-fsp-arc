Willie Rennie[00:15:00] We've got a climate emergency, we've got NHS waiting times that are as long as your arm, we've got an attainment gap that is as wide as ever. And we've got mental health waits, people waiting an age, young people waiting for a year, it's appalling. That's what we should be focusing on. We've got enough on our plate without arguing more about independence. Let's bring everybody here together. There are a lot of talented people in the parliament that could actually resolve things. We did it through the pandemic; we did some tremendous cross-party work on dealing with a massive challenge. I want more of that rather than more of the division that is inevitable even with the best of intentions of having a debate that's fruitful. We will have divisions and the divisions will lead to us taking more eyes off more balls and more people will lose their lives. This is very serious and we do need to focus.

Fiona Bruce[00:16:18] Doug?

Douglas Ross[00:16:18] We do; and that's where I believe we can, if we stop that SNP majority, focus on the recovery, on rebuilding, on drug deaths, on supporting the NHS, on rebuilding our educational standards.
