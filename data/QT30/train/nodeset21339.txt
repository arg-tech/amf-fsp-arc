[00:54:54] I've never been much of a flag waver, but when I was in Brussels as an MEP, the officials came round and snatched all the little mini Union Jacks that were in front of the Brexit Party MEPs and confiscated them, said they weren't allowed, and said that you shouldn't have symbols of nationalism, and I was surrounded in a European Parliament with the European flag everywhere we looked and everyone had mini European flags, the blue with the stars, so it made me realise that flags do symbolise something, because that was actually an assault on national sovereignty, not on the flag.
