Fiona Bruce[0:41:46] It is interesting that your answer to that question is not yes. You are equivocating.
Mark Harper[0:41:52] If you look at the report it highlights a lot of problems. Where I was coming to, most police officers I have ever met are trying to do the right thing. They are trying to protect people and they are trying to support the community. I'm sure the vast majority of officers in the Met are trying to do that. But you can't ignore a report that highlights serious problems. I was a Home Office minister which Teresa May set up this independent inquiry with reputable people on the Panel. It is a serious job of work they have done. What I'm a bit disappointed about is if you ahead up the institution and get a report like this, which is damning, you don't have to necessarily in the end accept all of it but you ought to have taken the trouble to ask yourself tough questions because there are clearly some issues. Just saying, yeah, it's all fine, which would be the implications of saying -- if I said there's no issue, I completely trust everybody in the Met, there's no problem with the institution at all, that would be running consider to that report.
