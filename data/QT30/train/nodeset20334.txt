Michael Forsyth[0:49:14] Listen. If you land a box of fish in Peterhead and want to get it to Northern Ireland, you used to be able to do that by the afternoon. Now it takes -- you are expected under some of the rules to give three days' notice of the plan.Fiona Bruce[0:49:32] These are rules the government agreed to.Michael Forsyth[0:49:34] I'm happy to debate with you, but if I finish the point. You're meant to give notice of 3 days of the landing of the fish. The fish are still in the sea at that point. It is a ridiculous rule. So what Michael Gove has done, he set up a task force under David -- what they need to do is sort out these petty, stupid regulations otherwise we are going to get into a very difficult situation where we have to look at the whole Northern Ireland protocol again.
