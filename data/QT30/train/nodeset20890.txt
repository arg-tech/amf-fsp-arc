Andrew RT Davies[00:44:57] Well, that was part of the manifesto and people voted for it, but what I'm saying to you is that people at this election will look at the manifestos and think do we need more constitutional chaos by having an independence referendum or do we come out positively from the COVID crisis, deal with the environmental challenges that we've got as well and the franchise will be the franchise. The point that Claire made is that all of us as politicians from the Assembly and wider society need to work to get better engagement across the whole of Wales, because regrettably only about 40, 45 per cent of the electorate engage with the Assembly elections as opposed to the general election in Wales which is 70, 75 per cent, so there is a big turnoff when it comes to Welsh Parliamentary elections, regrettably. 
Fiona Bruce[00:45:36] Is it a turnoff for you, Kay? You've got your hand up. 
Kay Unknown[00:45:38] I'd just like to say that I think the young people are our future and I sincerely hope that whatever government and the young people choose that they are going to be determined to put mental health and wellbeing as an investment at the forefront of services, because our young people have suffered during this pandemic and there is a crisis in mental health services.
