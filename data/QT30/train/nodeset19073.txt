Fiona Bruce [00:21:14] I’m going to move on if I may. You’ve had a good go, Douglas, I know. David Ross [00:21:20] Just on the quick action of the Scottish government. If I can. It is really important there’s quick action but also quick action for the businesses affected. Kate is finance Secretary here in Scotland and they are waiting 10 days now to get -- Kate Forbes [00:21:34] A far more generous opinion of support. David Ross [00:21:40] They had to wait 10 days to find out they’re getting 40 million pounds. We don’t know how that is going to be delivered [Unreportable cross-talk.] Please indicate, get that money out to businesses. Please. Fiona Bruce [00:21:54] Let me just, before we do, I want to get another question in. I want to mention that next week we are looking for people to join our virtual audience in Sedgefield, the week after in Lincoln. If you live in the area, please do get in touch. Get involved, we’d love to hear from you. Now to the next question, from Martin Dundas.
