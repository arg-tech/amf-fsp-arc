[00:10:25] So I'm not clear. So would you introduce plan B now?

Anas Sarwar
No, I would invest in Test and Protect, I would get the vaccine rollout ramped up. We know who's not vaccinated, we know where they live, we should be looking at door to door vaccinations. We should be looking at pop-up vaccination centres.

[00:10:39] But plan B is as basic as wearing a mask. 

Anas Sarwar
[00:10:42] Including wearing masks.

Kate Forbes
[00:10:40] Plan B is as basic as wearing a mask.

Anas Sarwar
[00:10:42] But I think it has to be more than just wearing a mask. So, yes, a mask is important, and, yes, leadership matters. So seeing parliamentarians giving lectures to the public about wearing a mask and then not wearing a mask themselves in parliament sends a very negative message. So show leadership yourself, have a strategy, and also, in Scotland, don't waste our time creating a vaccine passport scheme that doesn't work, that is a distractionâ€¦

Kate Forbes
[00:11:05] Having a vaccine plan B in England, that is part of the plan B in England.

Anas Sarwar
[00:11:07] And instead focus on investing in Test and Trace and getting testing right and getting vaccinations right across the country.
