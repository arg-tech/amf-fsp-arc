[00:28:21] It's a first in the G7, but also Deirdre Michie was writing in the P&amp;J earlier on this week about the Green plans, and it's not just the 100,000 jobs in the North East and in Scotland, it's 270,000 livelihoods that rely on the oil and gas sector here in Scotland. And that's what we've got to protect and that's what Scottish Conservatives are doing with our plans.

[00:28:49] That's our way of planning to get 200,000 new jobs.

Fiona Bruce
[00:28:51] Okay, we hear you and we've heard lots from you, Lorna, thank you very much. Let's hear from you, George.

[00:28:55] Hi. I grew up in Aberdeen so in 2014 the oil crash I saw the impacts of it myself. And it was quite disastrous to the city as a whole because even jobs which aren't directly in the oil industry get lost due to just the crash and no money in the city. So if we don't do a transition now, or at least have a plan to transition into a greener economy, we could risk jobs which could be saved if we act now. And in general, I would say everyone on the panel you were all arguing, like, back and forth for independence but for climate change there's less shouting. So it's more positive to see but we just need to continue this into actual action rather than just words.
