Fiona Bruce[0:19:22] How can you help Natalie there now. This has been going on for some time since Grenfell and Natalie is stuck.
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:19:30] Absolutely. The five billion fund is that starting point to make sure that we can start to get to grips with this. It is a huge you know, logistical exercise as you know, we know the extent of the cladding that isn't fit for purpose, but I hear absolutely the point you make which is of course, it is more than that, the challenge is with fire doors and all the access points and those issues. This is you know, this is a scandal that we are going to have to unravel. But I hope very much that the initial stages are going to be a starting point. I think that is the challenge with a number of these things is (A) understanding the scale of the problem which took us a while to get a full picture across the country. And to find the right tools to help move that forwards. I think this is a very difficult challenge. I feel enormously for Natalie I hope very much this is a starting point for solutions.
