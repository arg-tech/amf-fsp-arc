Fiona Bruce[0:23:30] Very briefly.
Ian Blackford[0:23:32] I do have some concerns, just as Sarah has said, that a lot of businesses are in deep financial difficulties with a debt pile that's increasing. In Scotland we don't have business rates for businesses in the hospitality sector.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:46] Briefly, Ian, I have to let other people in.
Ian Blackford[0:23:54] The government has to accept its responsibilities.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:58] Let me come to the audience. We really want to hear what you say but if you speak at that length no one else is going to get a word in. Nicola.
AudienceMember 20210624QT16[0:24:08] It seems to me we have wanted the government to follow the science all along and it seems to me they are doing that this time. Although it is frustrating and we all want to be back to normal, I do think of four weeks of the wonderful vaccination programme means a lot more people are detected. It is an early disease. We don't know the effects of long COVID; if we can prevent them, that is useful.
Fiona Bruce[0:24:36] Carlos?
AudienceMember 20210624QT17[0:24:38] This ideology coming from the government, the back benches that rebel is tortious at a time when we need to be taught the discipline to be in it together. You know, we all, more or less have common sense and realise that we're going to have to sacrifice another 4 weeks but it is the constant interference from the requirement to do that that is painful.
