Fiona Bruce[0:18:28] What does it look like?Lisa Nandy[0:18:28] Already their involvement with the UK and many of those people are in touch with us at the moment. They can't get through the roadblocks, can't get to the airport, even though the government is saying we will process your visa applications, they practically can't do it.Fiona Bruce[0:18:44] 5,000 in the first year, up to 20,000, does that sound realistic? Is that number supported?Lisa Nandy[0:18:50] I'm really glad the government has changed tack from the weekend when they seemed to be suggesting they didn't want to offer any assistance at all.James Cleverly[0:18:56] That's rubbish.Lisa Nandy[0:18:58] Sorry, the Home Office was briefing the media that if the government offered assistance, more people would come, and that's why they were reluctant to do. Now, the Home Secretary had a different line this morning, and I'm really glad about that, but what she is proposing, let's be clear about this, is up to 5,000 in the first year. Up to 5,000 people, when we already know that the scale of this crisis is going to be way beyond that.Fiona Bruce[0:19:24] I want to pin you down. How many refugees?Lisa Nandy[0:19:26] I know ...Fiona Bruce[0:19:28] Not a number, but hear me out, could you at least say whether the government is on the right track talking about 20,000? Do you think it should be more than that?Lisa Nandy[0:19:36] I don't think they are on the right track for two reasons. One is that it is absolutely clear that 5,000 is too small a number over the next 12 months and we've got to make a more generous offer than that. The second reason I don't think this is sufficient is because what became apparent today is that there is absolutely no plan to deliver it.
