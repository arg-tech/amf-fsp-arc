Fiona Bruce[0:56:24] Chris basically a last word from you?AudienceMember 20210916QT24[0:56:26] I think my friend would rather be in prison. She believes that she has been put in prison! And I think it is terrible to think that in her late years, when she is probably not going to live for much longer she doesn't have the comfort of her family around her and just half an hour once a week with one person who has been tested and putting her at no risk whatsoever.Fiona Bruce[0:56:54] Thank you for telling us about her story this evening. We really appreciate it.
