[0:55:10] Reading these exchanges were quite extraordinary. I think they probably say more about the Prime Minister than they do about Matt Hancock. That he believes his Health Secretary to be incompetent yet leaves him in charge to our response to a global pandemic. That in itself is shocking. I think the messages speak to the chaos in No. 10, the chaos in government, the lack of ability to get a grip, the fact we were too slow. If I was to pick who I would sack would it be Priti Patel because she broke the ministerial code, Matt for breaking the law? Michael Gove for breaking the law?

[0:55:54] Do you agree that Matt Hancock is totally hopeless.

Mark Harper
[0:55:58] No. When things are stressful, you sometimes say things you don't really mean.
