Fiona Bruce [00:43:22] Sarah? 

Sarah Jones [00:43:24] I was last on this programme on 30 January which was the day before we left the EU, and I can remember saying: We have no idea yet what the deal is anything to -- actual final deal is going to look like. We still have no idea what the final deal is going to look like 10 months later. It is ridiculous. The fact the government have got to this point where we are right at the cusp of the cut-off point is very bad management and it’s a very poor show. I think we know the deal is going to be thinner than it was promised to be. We were promised all bells and whistles and it is going to be thinner. There are significant issues we need to worry about. The government has told us the deal is there to be done. I am prepared to take them at their word and maybe the deal will be done and I hope it will. But I know the haulage industry, the logistic centuries are very worried about what’s going to happen. The government need to do what they said they were going to do, support businesses through Covid, then we need to look beyond, what kind of country are we going to build. How we’re going to build an economy next year is going to take more than Rishi Sunak in a fancy cashmere sweater telling us he is going to freeze public sector pay. We need a plan for what is the strategy going forward
