I think David Davis put it quite succinctly. Matt Hancock clearly made a big mistake. The next day he lost his job. He quite possibly lost his family as well. That's a horrible thing to happen to anybody. I think we should be careful about throwing stones at people. I'm sure we have all made mistakes, all done things we regret in the past. What I would like to know is if this happened on 6 May, why did it take the whistle-blower something like 7 weeks to put the story into a tabloid newspaper? Why did he wait so long to put it into a paper when he could have done something almost immediately? This incident would have been closed something like two months ago.

Fiona Bruce[0:10:52] We have no idea, A, who blew the whistle and, B, when they obtained that footage. It could have been a delay. All that is the great unknown, I'm afraid. Becky, you asked this question.
