Fiona Bruce[00:23:00] And Alan, you work in the oil and gas industry â€“ what's your perspective?
Alan Unknown[00:23:05] Yes, I do, I work in subsea sector. And we've had a number of challenges over the years, certainly in recent years, which has been exacerbated lately with the COVID-19 pandemic. But things seem to be stabling out a bit now but of course we now hear that the Green Party would like us to be ceasing production in the next ten years and potentially working alongside the SNP to support a majority there. Which is obviously a worry because it's a concern for people who work in the industry but also for further investment in the industry, which I think we need as a country.
Lorna Slater[00:23:43] Can I come in on that one? I absolutely understand your concern and I share the same concern for workers in the oil and gas industry. I'm a renewables engineer, I'm an electro-mechanical engineer, I work for a company that makes tidal turbines.
