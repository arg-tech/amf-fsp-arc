Ian Wood [00:48:24] I think we had a referendum five years ago. It is an incredibly important question. We should absolutely not be addressing it again. What’s gone completely wrong in the last two or three years is that we’ve got a Scottish government who generally are adversarial and negative about a whole range of things that might happen with the UK and Scotland working together. That’s what we should have. We don’t have a devolved government which is just looking after Scotland at all. We have a devolved government who are focused on independence. What we need is a devolved government who will work with the UK government. I have a list of six different things here which could happen, but right now are being held back because, frankly, the Scottish government’s position is they don’t want any big money help from the UK government because somehow it will cut across the the devolution right. So the structure and the system right now just isn’t working. If we could get that sorted out and, honestly, get both governments working together in a whole range of quite exciting things that could be done, we would be able to look ahead. We’re not. With great respect, the SNP have one objective in mind, that’s independence. Their actual job is to look after the Scottish people and get the best deal for the Scottish people. That’s not the priority right now.
