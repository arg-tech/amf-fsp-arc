Fiona Bruce[00:22:57] I mean, we've ordered far more than we need. We haven't actually got in the UK at this moment more than we need. I mean, would you be prepared to give up your vaccine, say, Camilla, for another country? 
Camilla Unknown[00:23:10] I can't say that because as a healthcare worker, I've had mine, so I'm sorry, I can't really answer that one. But I think that it is very important that we think altruistically as a global community because just bringing it back to the first question, none of us are going to really feel safe going on holiday until the other countries are safer than they currently are. 
Fiona Bruce[00:23:31] Claire? 
Claire Fox[00:23:33] This is a very important question because it's not the way it's been presented at all, you know? The idea that we're hoarding vaccines and stopping the Europeans getting the AstraZeneca vaccine is a nonsense.
