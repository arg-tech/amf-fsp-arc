Heather McGregor
[00:55:06] This is the most amazing city. This is the city where 300 years ago Adam Smith studied. And there was no rubbish collection in those days and it was still the best city in the world. The motto here in this city is let Glasgow flourish. I think Glasgow will flourish with COP26. Like you, I welcome it. I think it's going to be a great two weeks, rubbish or not.

Fiona Bruce
[00:55:27] Okay, Brian.

Brian Cox
[00:55:30] I think it's great that Glasgow is hosting COP26.
