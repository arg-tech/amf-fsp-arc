Paul Polman[0:57:36] I agree with most of this. In 2014, the International Energy Agency was saying the electric vehicles would be at the same cost as the combustion engine by 2050. We're getting to that in 2024/25. 60 percent of the energy can now be done green at a cheaper cost than the fossil fuel if we just put the right policies in place. In the world we still have 500 billion against fossil fuel. Many governments have put more money to the fossil economy than to the green economy. It doesn't have to cost more money. That is just a fallacy. By the way, when we invented the light bulb, it didn't work right away either. When we invented the computer, it didn't last more than one minute, you had to recharge them. We are well beyond that. Coming to the people itself, everything we do is not because of climate change, it is to ensure that everybody can have a decent life. We're doing this for inclusion. We're doing this for climate justice, equity and respect. So when we put a policy in place, like carbon pricing, which is absolutely needed, we should put the money we get from carbon pricing and be sure that the people who haven't seen their income move up in the last 3 or 4 decades don't have to pay a penny more but are better off so we don't have the yellow jackets in the street.
