Fiona Bruce[0:04:25] But people are now facing a perfect storm. The Bank of England's predicting inflation could rise above four per cent. As we all know now, because there's so much on the news about it, energy pricesâ€¦our bills are going to go up, and you're taking money away as well, so the situation has changed.
Grant Shapps[00:04:40] Also we've seen salaries go up actually by a bit more than four per cent, and this is not the only thing that we did for coronavirus, so for example, a local housing allowance is remaining, even though the increase was brought in for coronavirus. We've got children additions and allowances. We've expanded the working allowance. We've introduced healthy start vouchers and increased the amounts of money that goes for children costs being covered up from 70 to 80 per cent through the universal system. So we've done a whole lot of things, and your point to David was absolutely right, it's cost nine billion to run the increase in universal credit up to now, and it was introduced as a temporary measure. It would carry on being another six billion to carry on running. You have to then decide what to do. Do you carry on increasing other taxes that would be a penny on income tax, three or four p on say the cost of fuel, if you were to do that, that would increase the cost of living? So there are choices to make, and the government can't wait until the next election to have to make choices.
