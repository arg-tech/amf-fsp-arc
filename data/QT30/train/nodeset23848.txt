Hugh Osmond[0:07:50] Well, I think when people's livelihoods are put at risk you have to expect them to make a bit of a stand. I do respect that, you know, the British fighting for fishing and the French fighting for their rights. As I say, I think, really, in general, if you can achieve something by talking and negotiation, it is much better than sending gunships around the place.

AudienceMember 20210819QT05[0:08:20] I was reading about this this morning. It seems to be that the fishermen from France are coming over because they are complaining they haven't got their licences. But they knew they had to get the licences in January. It is no different than we were being told on a regular basis make sure you have all your documentation sorted. I think there was an advert from the government on a daily basis citing that if you trade internationally, your deadline is January, blah, blah, blah. I don't see why the governments in France and Germany and all the others didn't do the same thing. They should have had their paperwork in in time. They obviously haven't. You know, therefore, they can't -- it is just typical French, if they are unhappy about anything they do a blockade for everything. It is just typical of their national -- of stamping their feet and usually getting things sorted. But, no, I think that the French were completely wrong. They were well out of order, and they need to get their own act sorted. They need to do the paperwork and, you know, they can't complain to anybody if they are late.
