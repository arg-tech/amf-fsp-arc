Lisa Nandy[00:09:42] If you're telling me that people in places like Wigan and Manchester and London are stupid for voting for the Labour Party, then you can think again, Robert. It's an appalling argument.
Robert Buckland[00:09:50] Lisa, I went to Hartlepool and spoke to people on the doorstep, so I can tell you, they were fed up of Labour promises and no delivery. People living in the Headland estate in Hartlepool, not your traditional Tory voters…

Robert Buckland[00:10:15] You can talk as much as you like, that's the reality.
