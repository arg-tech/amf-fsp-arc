Fiona Bruce [00:05:54] What prompted you to ask this? Do you have concerns or what’s behind it? 
[Coleen]: Well, we haven’t really covered ourselves in glory so far at any logistical exercise. I mean with the PPE, test and trace, any of the things that have had to be done to do with Covid. So, yes, I have got concerns. I also think maybe the government should be managing expectations better. They seem to come out and say everything is going to be done by springtime. I think that’s highly unlikely given the record. I don’t know that a lot has been gained by suggesting that. It will be great if the military is involved. I think it will be much better if the military was involved in the command and control rather than just the delivery side. I hope that’s the case.
