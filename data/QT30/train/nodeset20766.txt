Mims Davies[0:51:40] We'd love to be giving more money but it is difficult. We wait for the pay review body. This is the start of it. The government made its recommendation, then it goes to this independent review.
Fiona Bruce[0:51:50] Got you. Victor.
Victor Adebowale[0:51:52] With all due respect I beg to differ with the questioner and I think many of my members would beg to differ as well. There was a lot of confusion and shock at the 1 percent pay rise suggestion. In the department's own planning guidance it talks about 2.5 percent increase. That was baked into the budget going forward. So people were surprised. I think the fact of the matter is the frontline during this pandemic has pulled this country through, is still pulling this country through a horrific ordeal. We need to understand that many of your NHS colleagues and many of my members are literally on their knees. They have worked so hard. It is not just they they have managed to drag us through the pandemic, they've also treated, in January, 1.3 million non-COVID patients. They have managed to maintain the health service for everyone else.
