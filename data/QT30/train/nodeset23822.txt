Mehdi Hasan[0:33:38] I do think we need to ask some hard, searching questions of ourselves. What was this for? What was the purpose of the war? How many lives were told to us? I would urge everyone watching to go to the Washington Post website and read the Afghanistan Papers, thousands of notes and memos, 400 officials, talking about how they knew this war was not winnable, they knew the country was falling apart, they knew the Taliban were stronger. That is the worst part about it, to see politicians this week saying, "I'm shocked at this collapse, shocked it didn't work out the way ... " They knew, they were discussing it amongst themselves that this Afghan army is not up to it, that there is corruption in the government, no-strike is not working, and they're not winning. They didn't tell the rest of us, a series of leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a massive, massive monumental failure on a - people talk about Iraq. This is on the same level. 20 years? Thousands of lives lost? And now arguing about do we take 5,000 or 10,000. What we've done in Afghanistan seriously deserves a huge accounting. [Applause].
