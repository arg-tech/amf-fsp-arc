Tim Stanley[0:24:12] We also need to know precisely what accommodation is safe and isn't safe. We need to see that which is not safe improved immediately because distress, and to finish by repeating, and it's not a financial problem, it's that technically people are living in unsafe accommodation. That should not be allowed to happen.

AudienceMember 20210916QT13[0:24:38] So, there's a couple of things here. I mean, who is liable for this? I mean, poor Natalie, if she had a fire now, is she insured? Why is it four years, and what is it going to take to get somebody to do something about this and make sure these buildings are safe for people to live in. Four years, and we don't know which ones are safe yet. Why should the leaseholders be left with this bill? It should predominantly be the contractors or actually, the planning departments and safety departments that pass these off? Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this, and it should not be the leaseholder. Why are the insurers in this?

AudienceMember 20210916QT14[0:25:20] I would like to go back to Anne-Marie, and you have alluded that this is the first step in a measure of steps that the Government are going to take. I would like to know what those next steps might be, and how that could maybe offer reassurance to the people that are currently living in fear and are in financial hardship.
