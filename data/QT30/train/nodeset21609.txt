Ian Blackford[0:53:14] The NFU go to great lengths every year to go around the supermarkets to get them to take our products in preference to lamb from elsewhere. There is this issue of cost. If I look at crofters in Skye or elsewhere, in the Highlands, there's no alternative to sheep farming. If we cannot make money from selling sheep, that livelihood, that way of life that has existed for generations comes to an end. You can yourself for what? For the ability to increase 0.2.
Mark Harper[0:53:46] There is an opportunity here for us to sell as well.
Ian Blackford[0:53:52] I'm talking about an industry that is going to be imperiled by the gross stupidity and willful negate your government people.
Mark Harper[0:54:04] Why wouldn't people still want to buy them?
Daniel Finkelstein[0:54:10] I listened to you careful. I have to reflect what you say. It is important. You have experience in that area. But you are suggesting we protect these industries by making everybody pay more for than food. Probably on another Question Time you'll come back and say we've got too much food poverty in this country.
