[Anthony Costello]
We need restrictions on indoor mixing and the wearing of masks and, realistically, we have to wait until we can get two dose levels up to, ideally above O percent. Because the more transmissible a virus, the more coverage you need in order to achieve herd immunity. So things could very quickly get out of control. Let's remember, a year ago in March we had 580 reported cases on 12 March, by the end of the month there were 1.8 million. 
 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Heather, let me come to you. If what Anthony is suggesting does come to pass, that has huge implications for business.
 
[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : Yes, it does. But there's a big difference between being told we have to wear masks on 21 June and actually stopping things opening.
 
[FIONA BRUCE] : He is talking about a restriction on indoor mixing, for example.
 
[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : There are so many -- you have to remember, I mentioned earlier how many people in the air transport industry are still on furlough.
