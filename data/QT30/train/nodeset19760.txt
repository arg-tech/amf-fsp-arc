Fiona Bruce [00:37:08] Chris, you started us off on this subject talking about your experience with your mother, and all our condolences to you for that, of course. What do you think about what you heard? Chris Auron [00:37:20] It hasn’t answered the initial question in the sense of we still didn’t lock down even though the statistics were there before Christmas. I mean we can all seem to agree that we probably should have locked down earlier or maybe we need a more severe lockdown. Have we seen the numbers from people gathering at Christmas and potentially spreading this virus? Have we seen how many people that is going to affect? Are we ready for it? And do we have the manpower to get that vaccine out there and the manpower in our hospitals to treat those people? As those numbers now are going to -- they are going to climb. They are going to get worse. More people are going to die from this virus.[DONE] Fiona Bruce [00:38:02] I think we all know the numbers are going to climb, certainly for a while yet before, hopefully, they start to come down.
