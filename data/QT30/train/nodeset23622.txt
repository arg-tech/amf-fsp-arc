Fiona Bruce[0:31:24] We have got lots of hands up. Yes. You have got your hand up very high! The woman with the glasses at the back there.
AudienceMember 20211014QT21[0:31:30] I think the problem here is the elephant in the room and nobody wants to admit to it in the Government is Brexit. The Brexit movement was driven on an agenda driven by lies. Boris lied in his speech about the things that the Government are proposing to do. They have had 5 years to prepare for it, but there was no plan. The plan was for David Cameron to win back his backbenchers. The plan was to get out the foreigners, but you know, other than that, there was no economic basis in leaving the EU and this is just showing that, and I think the tide is turning.

AudienceMember 20211014QT22[0:32:12] Is part of the issue the fact that we haven't been able to secure as many trade deals as we had been promised originally as part of the Brexit campaign? Secondly, from a seasonal worker prospective, if we're trying to employ people to come from abroad, why would you come abroad with temporary restrictions such as you can stay here for 2 months and help us out, but we don't want you after that. It is hypocritical and lunacy.
