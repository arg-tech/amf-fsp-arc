Fiona Bruce[00:28:40] Well, they’ve done a lot better in terms of their death toll.
Steve Parish[00:28:43] They have done better in terms of their death toll, but I think when we look back on this, 10,000 deaths is too many. You know, for this to get to the extent that it did into the amount of countries that it has. You know, the world really needs to look at it and make sure that these kind of outbreaks are jumped on way before the kind of things we’re discussing now, because we are talking about a pandemic that is broadly out of control in the world that we’re trying to get on top of, and it is going to be extremely difficult. And we do need to come together as a country, private enterprise, the governments, both sides of the House and try and find a solution in the next two or three months, or we really could be in a terrible situation.
Fiona Bruce[00:29:22] Mike, you’ve had your hand up from the start?
Mike[00:29:25] Yes, I was going to say, with Apple and Google there’s good parts in both applications, surely these companies could come together for once, you know, because there’s a big pandemic going on, and sort of put the resources together.
