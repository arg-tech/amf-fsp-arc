Fiona Bruce[0:52:40] Jenni. 
[JENNI MURRAY] : I think people underestimate the amount of poverty this pandemic has caused. I live in a quite well-off part of London and I'm okay. You know, I own my own house. We have a food bank that is absolutely flooded out with people who simply cannot afford to buy food for their children. I cannot think of anything more damaging to one's mental health to be a woman renting a house or a flat with two children and terrified because she can't pay her rent, that at any minute she is going to be evicted. That is criminal. Absolutely criminal. 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Jenni, what would you say to someone, a landlord who was renting out one property and that rent was enabling them to stay in their own property. What would you say to them?
