Fiona Bruce[0:27:08] You mean encourage young people in and older people out?
Theo Paphitis[0:27:14] No, no, not at all. Bad news. My first job, I left school at 16. Very little qualifications, dyslexic, sent a hundred applications out and got, like, a hundred rejections. Mind you, my applications wouldn't have been good reading with my spelling. But actually the only reason I got a job, my first job, was because at the time the Government were giving allowances to businesses. I think it was about 15 hundred quid a year, it was a lot of money, to take on somebody of a certain age who hadn't had a job before. And that -- so they took me on when they were not sure they should be spending 1,500 quid, but the fact was, it was subsidised and that gave me my first job and opportunity and then I could move on from there. We need initiatives like that that are going to -- because the measures that the Chancellor has put in, but it was required. It had to be done very quickly, and I am afraid some people went through the net.
