Michelle Donelan [00:50:10] So this is about the agreements that we have. I don’t think we are anticipating that if we enter into agreements with other countries that suddenly they are not going to be respected en mass at all. Fiona Bruce [00:50:22] Obviously we had cod wars before so it wouldn’t be entirely unprecedented. Tom Kerridge [00:50:30] From an industry that needs a deal to come through as quickly as possible, it is the uncertainty of being able to move forward. Time is running out very, very quickly. Personally speaking, any deal is going to be better than no deal. The way that the prices are going to rise, the way -- the uncertainty of the market. We are not a self-sufficient country. You know, we export -- we only produce 70 percent of the meat that we need in this country for us. We import at least 30 percent. We have the trade tariffs that need to be sorted out. Time is running out so rapidly, as we get to the end of Covid 19, we are at Brexit. You know, all of these pressures that it’s put us under, there’s so much where hospitality can bring to the forefront of regenerating, of being part of the high street. We talk about high streets and retail bid in trouble. A retail experience generating movement, cash, everything flowing, without hospitality being a part of that, why would you be going to the high street? How do we drive things forward? We need a solid foundation. We need the Brexit deals decided, we need to be able to move forward. We need to future-proof the hospitality industry. It is the beating heart and soul of communities. That’s the other thing that we’re forgetting here when we talk about the offers that we put in. It is not just what we sell. We don’t just sell food and drink, we give the fabric of society -- it’s intertwined with meeting up, being a whole part of it. That is a foundation as a whole country, no matter what business it is , to be able to drive forward.
