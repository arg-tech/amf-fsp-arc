[PETER KYLE] : Where we got it really wrong is when there's ambiguity. Remember at the beginning we were told the pubs were staying open but don't go to them. Everybody was confused. We were told to take our own advice, which wasn't good enough in a public health emergency. Right now we are being told we have amber, green and red. Make your own mind up if it is amber. We should have green and red, there shouldn't be an amber. We need absolutely crystal clarity so we can act together as a country and act together based on scientific advice we all understand and we can move forward as a country, not always being told one thing, advised another thing, then being made to feel personally responsible for it. [FIONA BRUCE] : Pierce, you said you were originally planning to go to Portugal. You mentioned the green list there, Peter. Portugal is now off the green list as of today. [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : I just found out today. I didn't realise that until about an hour ago that Portugal is off the green list. It is very disappointing.
