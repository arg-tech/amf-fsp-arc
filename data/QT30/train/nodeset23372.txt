Ian Blackford[0:11:58] I applaud our care workers, our frontline works for everything they have done and the fact that so many in the care community have taken the vaccine so we don't face this problem. I do think -- when you look at everything that has happened over the last while, the fact the unlocking has been put back a few weeks. You have a government in London that continual overpropositions, you end up in a situation it hasn't been able to win the war on this and convince people the way it should have done they need to be vaccinated. That's the difference.
Fiona Bruce[0:12:32] Sean, do you want to come back in?
AudienceMember 20210624QT14[0:12:36] I just obviously wanted the right to reply to the gentleman. You know, I don't need telling how, you know, how important it is for vulnerable people. I am one of those vulnerable people. I had sepsis in the first part of the pandemic. The point I'm making to tell people that unless they have chemicals, and let's be honest, I'm not anti-vaccine, that's what it is in it's simple left form, or they are going to lose their jobs, that is appalling. We have been told to clap these people, now we're telling them they're not going to have a job. Are you going to say visitors to care homes and hospitals have to be vaccinated? You know?
