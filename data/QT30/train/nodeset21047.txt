Willie Rennie[00:46:10] But at the heart of this, we need to deal with the problem that pervades much of the public services, which is our mental health problem. We're not training any more psychiatrists and psychologists than we did five years ago. We need to have mental health first-aiders in every single work place so we can reduce the demand on the NHS. We also need to make sure that we're deploying the mental health counsellors that are in the community to be able to take the load off there as well. So, that will help significantly. We also need to localise health services because people have got used to health services being much more local, whether it's using the technology or in their local centre. We need to make sure that the specialists are available at a local level, again, to reduce the demand, to do the preventative work, so that we can actually get the NHS back on track. This has got to be one of our top priorities because we need to invest in our NHS to make sure people get the treatment that they need on time.
