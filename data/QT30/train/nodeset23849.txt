Fiona Bruce[0:09:48] The French might take issue with that characterisation, I dare say. What they are saying is the new conditions have been attached to the licences which they didn't know about. That's the main gist of their gripe. Deborah.
Deborah Frances-White[0:10:04] I wish Boris Johnson would stop getting up in the morning and saying: How can I be Churchill today? It is childish. I think the public of both countries would like both leaders to be grown up. We're not children -- well, we're not children. I think sometimes that's their first response. It is disappointing to the public. It is disappointing to everybody here.

John Bercow[0:10:32] I think there's an important point here. It isn't a question of people not filling in forms that they knew they had to complete. What is at stake is an argument about the behaviour of the Jersey authorities and, more particularly, the British government, in surreptitiously introducing new regulatory burdens and compliance requirements with minimal notice, of which the French fishermen couldn't have been aware.

Fiona Bruce[0:11:04] Jersey disputes that.

John Bercow[0:11:06] It is a violation of the principles and the intended application of the Trade Agreement. That's the first thing. In a sense of backhanded compliment to Robert, whom I served with in the House, it is remarkable through the deployment of his mellifluous tones he can talk about solving a problem when solving a problem means a betrayal of the British fishing industry and its decimation on the one hand, and, frankly, the denial of the rights, very long established over decades and more, of French fishermen.
