Sarah Jones[0:18:04] People have a lot of debt they're building up. The restaurants that don't have outside space can only have a third capacity. They are running at a loss. But this government didn't lock down, didn't do what we told them to do from January, February, the start of this year. So we have our wonderful vaccination programme; on the other hand we are throwing it all away by not securing our borders. It is bad policy from this government and they need to make sure it is not people really struggling that end up suffering.Fiona Bruce[0:18:36] Mark, you led the Commons rebellion against this unlocking for another four weeks. When you were on the programme last in April, you wanted to unlock them, in February.Mark Harper[0:18:48] No, in February --Fiona Bruce[0:18:52] You were on in February, you wanted to unlock in April. Given what's happened with the Delta variant do you think we would be in a worse place now?Mark Harper[0:19:02] Going directly to Nicola's question, should we have delayed getting back to normal for another four weeks, no, I don't think we should. We have now offered a second dose of vaccine to all of the top nine groups, the groups that accounted for 99% of death over 85% of vaccinations.
