Lisa Nandy[00:56:20] I would just put in a plea to say that there are parts of this country now, including mine, that have been in near continuous lockdown for over a year and if we're going to move forwards we've got to move forwards in step. We can't be saying to people in those parts of the country you haven't hugged your mum for a year and we don't know when it's going to end. We need to see the Government coming forward and getting back on the front foot about this and giving people clarity and saying the country will move together. And then, if you do that, Robert, this is a promise, I will give you a hug.
