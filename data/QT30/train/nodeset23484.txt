Paul Polman[0:33:08] Coming to independent -- the only country with tropical forests, has seen a rapid decline in deforestation. They are continuing with that. They put a price of carbon in place. They have aggressive government policies to continue in that direction because they know the world doesn't want unsustainable palm oil anymore. They know they are destroying livelihoods of indigenous people if they continue like this. So the country is actively involved in preserving our natural capital. In fact, Indonesia is probably best placed in the future in this world to monetise the enormous natural capital that they have to confer their economy to this greener more sustainable economy.

Fiona Bruce[0:34:02] I'm sorry, Paul, forgive me. I'm going to bring in the rest of the panel. The question is, given that Russia, India and China didn't turn up, how successful are the breakthrough pledges of COP-26, a glimmer of hope or blah blah blah.

Tim Stanley[0:34:24] The leaders didn't have support but I'm feeling positive about COP, actually. What it has done is come up with deadlines and goals, but the thing is they push the world in a certain direction. Once, most catalytically, we begin to invest private capital in the technology, that will develop momentum.
