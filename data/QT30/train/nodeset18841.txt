Fiona Bruce[00:02:53] Jed?

Jed Mercurio[00:02:54] Well, firstly, I think we all want to pay tribute to Marcus Rashford for the campaign. You know, what a great example this young man is as well as being a fantastic footballer, and I say that as a Manchester United fan, so maybe I’m biased. But what I would also say is that I sometimes despair of hearing things called U‑turns. I think it stops people in positions of authority from listening and changing their minds and responding to the democratic force that got behind Marcus’ campaign. And sometimes I worry that if we use that type of language it sometimes makes it more difficult for governments to do the right thing. And I would definitely say that it’s something that we should all welcome, the fact that the government listened and acted in the way that it has.

Fiona Bruce[00:03:51] And Charlie, you’re a teacher, what was your response?

Charlie Shrimpton[00:03:54] But, Jed, if you use language such as a U-turn…or if you do the right thing in the first place, you will not need to use that language at all. My experience is that I see every day how these vouchers make an impact. And the difference of a child having a meal and coming to school is far greater than not having a meal at all and it gives them the opportunity to be able to flourish, and for that there is no price.
