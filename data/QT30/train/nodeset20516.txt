Fiona Bruce[0:40:26] There's a few medics in our audience. I want to hear from you.
Audience Member 13[0:40:34] I'm sympathetic to Grant's reasoning as to why it was difficult to get enough PPE. But, again, that doesn't answer the question. The question was, was there a shortage? There was a shortage. Your entire answer was explaining why it was difficult to get it and why there was a shortage. But you have to acknowledge there was a shortage. Yes, it was difficult to get it but I know colleagues, personally, who were in unprotected situations that got COVID. I have family friends, colleagues, who are medics who died from COVID having not had PPE. For you to sit there and say there was no shortage is grossly insulting. I would much rather you said: This is really hard. It's really hard for us to have got the PPE yes, therefore we weren't able to get it all and there was a shortage. We can then understand that rather than you denying the fact that there was a shortage.
