Fiona Bruce [00:29:26] Mark, you’re nodding away to that. Are you frustrated? Mark Walport [00:29:32] Yes. Inevitably. I think this new variant has made things much, much more difficult. I think the challenge has been, really, the policy compromises between managing the economy, work, education, and managing the coronavirus has meant actually damage to neither has been minimised as much as it could have been. Fiona Bruce [00:29:50] Jim. [Jim]: It seems to me that one of the key reasons why lockdown occurs is to protect the NHS. Nightingale hospitals were built in the first lockdown with the help of the army, and they are huge facilities. Yet we don’t seem to be able to use those. I know it is because of a lack of resource, doctors and nurses to support those, to work in them. I’m wondering why more hasn’t been done to get those resources into play now. Fiona Bruce [00:30:30] James?[DONE] [James]: I think, look, you know, no one wants to put the economy before human life. We seem to have privatised schools but at the minute we’re getting none of it right. The economy is in tatters, 1,104 people died today and schools are shut. We’re not getting any of the balancing act right at all.
