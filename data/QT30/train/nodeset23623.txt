Why are we letting people get away with these dibolical actions. Going back to the Prince Andrew thing...

What does it say about the respectability of the monarchy in the UK? It is going downhill. I have so much respect for the Queen, but why are we letting this happen? What's going on like women's safety in general? Why do I no longer feel safe...

That was a police officer. That was an incredible misuse of the power which must never be allowed to happen again. I would argue that's what we need to look for.

The Prince Andrew question, he should be - he should go to the States and he should be held accountable, but going back to what the lady said. The culture of misogyny of men treating women very badly indeed has gone on for far too long and for me, what is most concerning is that I believe there are a lot of cuts to women's services. Now a lot of these cuts in Universal Credit and other financial cuts are going to affect women most. Women are always the most vulnerable in society. They're always the ones in receipt of the most punitive financial cuts and just think we've got to re-think this.
