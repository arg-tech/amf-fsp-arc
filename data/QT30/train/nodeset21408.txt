Fiona Bruce[00:47:46] Nick, is this Australia trade deal a good deal for Britain?
Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:47:49] Well, it depends on its terms. I'm certainly in favour of completing a trade deal with Australia, but it has to contain a level playing field for our famers. So let's take, for example, hill farmers in my native Wales. Clearly it's going to be more difficult for them to compete with farmers in Australia on climate, for example, on space, on animal welfare standards and environmental standards which are higher here in the United Kingdom. So that has to be taken into account in putting this deal together. I'd expect the Australian government to stand up for its agricultural interests, of course it would. Our government must do the same and not sell out our farmers.
Fiona Bruce[00:48:31] Okay. Lots of nodding there from our audience I can see. Let's take a last question now from Will Drakes.
