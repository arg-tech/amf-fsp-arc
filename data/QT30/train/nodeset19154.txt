Part 13
Chris Philp MP[0:19:48] Well, the point I was making is my colleagues in government are not there for reasons of tokenism, they’re there because they’re incredibly talented, energetic, hardworking…
Bonnie Greer[0:19:55]You didn’t hear anything I said.
Chris Philp MP[0:19:56]…dynamic people. And of course I understand we’ve got to dismantle any barriers to anyone achieving their potential, because, in the words of Martin Luther King Junior that Anthony quoted a minute ago, what matters is the content of someone’s character, their ability, their talent. We should be unfettered. People should be able to go as far as they can go…
Bonnie Greer[0:20:10]I never used the word token, you did. You used it twice.
Chris Philp MP[0:20:14]No I didn’t.
Bonnie Greer[0:20:15]I never said token.
Chris Philp MP[0:20:17]He did. Someone did. It wasn’t me.
Bonnie Greer[0:20:18]I never said token.
Marie van der Zyl[0:20:19]I think today we should concentrate a bit more on the Labour party antisemitism, because when you look at what Jeremy Corbyn did this morning in his speech he totally tried to say that it wasn’t so important. He even tried to suggest he’d made improvements, and he’s someone that’s got accept responsibility. And I think the lessons from the Labour party are what we should be really focusing on today.
