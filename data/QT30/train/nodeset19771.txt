Fiona Bruce [00:55:08] Andrea. [Andrea]: So I’m also self-employed and I’ve also fallen through the gaps completely. I have a work room in my own house so I don’t qualify for a business grant. I don’t have stock so I don’t qualify for any other subsidies. I tried to look at the self-employed version of the furlough scheme, not applicable to me. So there’s absolutely nothing. There’s huge amounts of talk within the Conservative government about supporting small actions, about trying to get small industry, crafts people going and get creative in there, but why is it so difficult for anybody to get anything unless you’ve either got three accountants working for you or practically destitute? [DONE]Fiona Bruce [00:56:08] Annaliese? Anneliese Dodds [00:56:12] I think we just heard from so many people how hard it is for businesses in the moment in the UK. Unfortunately, we are in a situation where the country has had the worst recession of all major economies. We had the double tragedy, terrible health outcomes and a very, very poor economic situation as well. I would just say that the chancellor talks about how he put 280 billion pounds into his plan for jobs. That is a very significant investment but so much of that money has not been targeted effectively. We’ve seen the supermarkets, they’ve been giving money back that they received through the grant scheme. Where has that gone? We said as Labour we think that should be focused on some of those people like Andrea who have been missed out of those schemes. Some of the excluded groups.
