David Davis[0:22:30] One of the things I'm going to be doing come 19 July is saying okay, what's left over from a year of ministerial decisions -- not Parliamentary decisions, ministerial decisions -- on a vast range of subjects where we have given up our freedoms. I want to see us get back as close as we can to usual. In the middle of all that we are going to be having the government making plans to deal with future pandemics as Benjamin referred to. But we have to get back to our country running as normal. That's what the public want, I think. That's what we ought to deliver.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:10] Amanda, you are shaking your head at that. Why is that?
AudienceMember 20210708QT08[0:23:16] I don't personally have the confidence to actually walk out in the streets without a mask on. I was on holiday last week, I was lucky enough to get away to Cornwall, and Cornwall, a lot of it is in lockdown because of the G7. The proximity of so many people, I don't have the confidence that somebody is not going to sneeze on me or coughing on me.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:52] The rise in cases in Cornwall is due to the summer breaks. I'm not sure it is quite as clear-cut as that. Andrea.
