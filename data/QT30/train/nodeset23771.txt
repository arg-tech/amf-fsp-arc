Fiona Bruce[0:27:02] This is a long way to go on that?

Fiona Bruce[0:27:28] Let me just I need to get round the panel. Jon?
Jon Ashworth[0:27:36] Listening to Natalie, the fact you have been so let down is unforgiveable, and thank you for speaking to openly and bravely, and I know there will be many leaseholders who feel the same and don't have the confidence to come out on television and speak about their personal circumstances. Thank you for what you have done. I agree with Daisy, and with Tim, having disagreed with Tim on the last I agree with him on this one. Now, I lead for the Labour Party on health, I have not been involved in the particulars of the Bill. I will speak more broadly and say, as it happens, I was on Question Time the week of Grenfell, and the panel and the audience were united in grief.
