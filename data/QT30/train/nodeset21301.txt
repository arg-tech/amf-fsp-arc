[00:26:32] Okay. Andrea, in our audience.

[00:26:35] Hi, Fiona, thank you. So I'd just like to say the last independence referendum we had in Scotland was very divisive for families and friendships. And we are still healing from that independence referendum, we've still not got over it. Now, in the recent leaders debates in Scotland, our Scottish leaders were fighting like rats in a sack at the debates about independence. There is no talk about social care. There was nothing about tackling child poverty. Education, where are our teachers. Nicola Sturgeon herself admitted in one of the debates that she'd taken her eye off the ball. And Kate is a fine example of everything that's wrong with the SNP. As we were talking about the problems with Labour, Kate actually cannot stop herself from bringing up the constitution. And it is just a neverendum that needs to be brought to a close.
