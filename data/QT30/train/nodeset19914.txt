Arlene Foster [00:50:06] I think it is important that we see the union for what it is. It is choice. For me it is much more, it is that I’m a no one can take that away from me. But we are in our cent triyear now. When Northern Ireland was created there were many that believed it wouldn’t last very long here we are celebrating 100 years. That is because of the strength of all of our people here in Northern Ireland to not concentrate actually, as Louise said to concentrate on the an everyday basis. If you look at what has happened throughout this past year with COVID, and Brandon talked on this, we have not only received 3 billion pounds in terms of support. The furlough scheme which helped a lot of ordinary people in their working lives, the self-employment scheme, but of course our National Health Service which is very much at the heart of our union, very key to us, the fact we have been able to take part in the UK-wide vaccination programme which has put us ahead of other parts of the world. Even today when we had to call in for military assistance we were able to do that because we are part of United Kingdom. So there are rational, logical reasons why we must remain within the UK, as well as if you look at -- and Brandon made this point earlier in the week -- it is what Northern Ireland brings to the United Kingdom at well. If you look at Queen’s University, it has just been awarded the best entrepreneurial university, beating Cambridge. So we have a strong education system, a great National Health Service, so a rational, logical basis I think people will continue to choose to be within the United Kingdom. It is, of course, under the Belfast Agreement for the consent of the people of Northern Ireland and there is nothing to show that the people of Northern Ireland want to leave the United Kingdom in any of the opinion polls.
