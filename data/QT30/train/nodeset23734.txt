Fiona Bruce[0:33:43] And do you think the police should have extra powers to stop the M25 protestors?
AudienceMember 20210930QT21[0:33:47] Well, I think they should do more about it, you know, I've listened so much to the radio the last 18, 22 months, and yeah, sometimes my heart is just going a bit crazy about things. Also if you're for example a mother with a baby in the back, and then you're stuck for five hours there, maybe your bottle runs out, so…
Fiona Bruce[0:34:10] What are you going to do, yes, exactly. Can I just ask, does anyone here support what the protestors are doing on the M25 and think it might be inconvenient, but actually it's the right thing to do, you've got your hand up there.
AudienceMember 20210930QT22[0:34:22] It's inconvenient and it's not the best way, but if the government did something about things, they wouldn't have to take those actions, so if…do something and then they'll stop. 
Fiona Bruce[0:34:33] The man at the back in the grey top.
AudienceMember 20210930QT23[0:34:36] Yeah, I agree with the lady, there wouldn't be a problem if the government did something about climate change, instead of claiming to be, you know, the leader of the world in climate change, why don't we actually do something about it instead of just claiming.
