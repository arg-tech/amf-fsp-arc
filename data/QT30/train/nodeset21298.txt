Lisa Nandy[00:32:59] Look, I do recognise that there is a problem here, because you have a number of people in Scotland, a sizeable number of people, who are deeply unhappy with the status quo. A number of those want to see Scotland leave the United Kingdom. I believe it's incumbent on all political parties, including my own, UK-wide parties, to show that by being in the United Kingdom Scotland is better off, and I believe we have to make that case. And I think that's particularly the case where you've got a government in Westminster that has consistently failed to stand up for the interests of people in Scotland, whether it's over Scotch whisky tariffs or the offshoring of industry, as they failed to stand up for people in Greater Manchester where I'm an MP. And I recognise that has to change, but the idea that in the middle of a global pandemic, after years and years of division we find multiple ways to divide ourselves from each other over recent years, that what we should be focusing on is yet more division, yet more navel gazing, when we've got serious problems to solve like the growing waiting lists, the crisis of social care and the lack of jobs in many parts of this country. I think that is completely wrong. We've got to focus on the country and what unites us right now.
