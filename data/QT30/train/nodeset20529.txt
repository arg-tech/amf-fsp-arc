Anneliese Dodds [0:56:22] You know, Jo is right, we can't squeeze more out of the existing system. We need to provide the resource, and it will be worth it in the longer term because not doing that will mean that whole cohorts of children and young people will have been left behind, to an extent.

Audience Member 21 [0:56:40] I couldn't agree more. Three or four weeks summer holiday, schooling, it's a drop in the ocean. It is not going to do anything. It has to be a much longer-term thing here. To back what my fellow audience members have said, this summer is surely about the kids getting out, enjoying themselves, being with their friends, hugging their grandparents, going to pubs and restaurants, getting their hair cut. They need that break as much as everyone else.
