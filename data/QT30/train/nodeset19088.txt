David Ross [00:39:56] That’s not fair. 

Kate Forbes [00:39:58] It is a primary source of funding that is the principal area means by which we have to mitigate the effects. Now we worked together, but I think it is ludicrous that just as we are seeing the rate of infection increase, and the likelihood of restrictions, we’re seeing the end of what has been a life line. I accept, I have been open and honest, that it has been a life line for many businesses. Now is not the time to end it. Everybody can see it, every business the length and breadth of the country can see it but the chancellor can’t appear to see it. 

David Ross [00:40:36] In fairness, you and the Labour Party welcomed, when the Chancellor announced the replacement furlough, you both welcomed it at the time. You said it was right there was a replacement. But to say you were waiting for the chancellor to outline any further support you could give, the chancellor has said Scotland will get 700 million more. 

Kate Forbes [00:40:56] Or on Friday. 

David Ross [00:40:58] Why today did Nicola Sturgeon say it would be 40 million going to the businesses.
