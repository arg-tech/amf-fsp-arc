Fiona Bruce[0:47:54] Okay, but the question is, Munira, how can GP practices be supported to provide quality care for patients so that we can see them face to face, I think that's what you're getting at, Sarah.Munira Wilson[0:48:02] Well, I think as we start to roll out the booster programme, booster jab programme for instance, I think we should be relying much more on community pharmacy, for instance, and some of the vaccination hubs in my constituency, the big vaccination hub has been shut down.Fiona Bruce[0:48:14] No, no, the question is about seeing GPs face to face, not going to your pharmacy.Munira Wilson[0:48:17] No, no, but the point I'm making is that if there is less pressure on GPs from other things such as the vaccination programme, they will be freed up a bit more to see people face to face. We need investment in our GP surgeries, we need to recruit and train far more GPs. There's huge workforce pressures across the NHS, GPs being one of them, so it's about that long term investment. In the short term, it's trying to find ways to free them so that they can see you face to face, and don't forget there are people who actually prefer the remote triage, so where people are happy to be seen remotely, that's probably a quicker way to be seen, then that frees up time for people to be able to see others face to face.
