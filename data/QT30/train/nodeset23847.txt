Fiona Bruce[0:06:08] Hang on. We were was the government right to send Royal Navy ships to Jersey? Were they right to do that?Thangam Debbonaire[0:06:16] If they were right, which I dispute, I think it is not a dip the French were in the country yesterday. There was perfectly affirm opportunities. But my point is if they are going to do this, if they are sending the gun ships out for the fishing century, defending the other industries that have suffered as a result of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.Hugh Osmond[0:06:52] It is a failure of diplomacy on both sides. It should have been dealt with diplomatically. Who was to blame for sending ships where, it is very difficult to say. Clearly the French behaved badly, whether our response was proportionate, it is difficult to say. It should have been dealt with a long time before it got to the situation of sending out gun boats. There's higher priorities for the Royal Navy than floating around in Jersey. There's what's going on in the China Sea and around Russia. There's much higher priorities. It shouldn't have got to that.Fiona Bruce[0:07:32] The one thing for the French fishermen is people are at least now paying attention to them. I wonder if Scottish fishermen, who feel so betrayed by the Brexit deal, they might be wondering if they should be taking a leaf out of the French fisher folks' book.
