He was able to excite everyone with his slogans, but when you listen to what he said, he said nothing and the fact that he is saying that there are these supply chain issues and shortages are part of a plan is, frankly, insulting to millions of people who will be fighting a winter of hardship because of these cuts and shortages.

[0:15:26] The minister's answer focused on getting people back to work. My concern is that people have had benefits cut and can't get back to work. People who have disabilities. People who are not able to work. A personal friend of mine will face double fuel bills this winter and his benefits have been reduced. I think that's where we need to focus. A lot of people are going to be in a very dire situation this winter.

[0:15:52] I've listened to what you've all said and I've particularly enjoyed the comment regarding Boris Johnson's speech. As far as I was concerned it was a masterclass in theatrical bombast, and what concerns me is this idea that this was an uplift for Universal Credit. It is about a bit like saying we're going to give you a pay rise, but we're going to take that money away when prices go up, which is what is happening.
