Fiona Bruce [00:32:58] Seema. Seema Malhotra [00:33:00] I was very surprised to hear that the job support scheme was talked about by David Ross there as being the same as the furlough scheme. Even Dame Lewis Casey has come out to say if you are going to say that you’re going to pay two-thirds of someone’s salary you should also be saying they can only afford two-thirds of their rent or pay for two-thirds of the food for their family. We have a system that is currently -- decisions being made by the prime minister and the chancellor that are pushing people into destitution. The most important thing we need to do right now is look at how we both deal with the health crisis that we’re facing as well as the economic crisis. I have had many employers tell me that the scheme is not going to incentivise them to keep on employees, especially as times get tough again. Many in the aviation industry as well, who are suffering from the slow down. That’s because when the government talked about this scheme as trying to keep people on part time, actually, it is more essential to keep two people on part time than it is to keep one person on full time. Rather than this, the government should be looking at what has been done in Germany and elsewhere and what the Labour Party has been saying to have a proper short hours scheme that supports people to stay in work and in their jobs part time. Because the cost of long-term unemployment is much greater than what we’re going to otherwise have to pay to keep people in their jobs, in viable jobs, that will be there when we come through this next period.
