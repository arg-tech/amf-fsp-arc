Fiona Bruce [00:34:02] I’m sorry to interrupt you. I have to let everybody in as well. But you feel so passionately about it. It is the heart and soul of what you do. Let’s hear from our audience. Jai. [Jai]: This is an argument that is going to rumble on for months to come. Don’t we all think it is time that we have a minister in partly for hospitality. Fiona Bruce [00:34:26] Tom is nodding at that. Liam Halligan [00:34:28] He wants the job! . Fiona Bruce [00:34:32] It could be a new gig for you. [Andy]: I think the hospitality industry has been given some guidelines. I think in some way it can be self regulated. From my point of view, if I was going to go to a restaurant and I thought they were sticking to the guidelines well, I would go to that restaurant or pub. You see some not doing it so well, you wouldn’t go. So long as there’s Guidelines, these places need to be open. I’m sure they need to be open because there’s a lot of jobs at stake in this sector. So, you know, a little bit of self-regulating, I think, then people can make their own choice: I’m not going to go in that pub because it looks too busy and too loud.
