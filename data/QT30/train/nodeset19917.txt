Fiona Bruce [00:39:56] Let’s get an answer to Julie Anne’s question. Arlene, I’ll start with you. Can you guarantee that she is going to get her second dose and when will she get it? 

Arlene Foster [00:40:12] This is something we discussed very recently in relation to the fact that this evidence was coming out the Israel that the dose should have been given within the time period initially thought about. I understand that the chief medical officer, chief scientific officer are speaking to the Israeli about what we are being advised. We are not scientists, not doctors, so we take our advice from our chief medical officers and scientific advisers and they are saying to us that the first dose does give you a certain amount of protection and that protection alongside all of the other measures in terms of social distancing, wa our hands, doing all of the that first dose then the second dose will be administered. In terms of Northern Ireland, our care homes, I think it is 80 percent of our care home residents have received the second dose of the Pfeiffer vaccine. We are pleased about that. will give them the protection they need. In terms of our vaccination programme in Northern Ireland in terms of the number of people per head of population who have been vaccinated. I think that that has worked very well with both of the vaccines. Making sure we use the Pfeiffer vaccine in the appropriate way then our GPS rolling out the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine as well.
