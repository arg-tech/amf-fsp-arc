Fiona Bruce[0:53:51]Well, Billy, you’re a doctor, and you talk to your colleagues on the frontline. What is the answer? What’s your view?Male Aud 6[0:54:01]There’s not an easy solution I’m afraid to the current problem. Certainly adopting the Swedish model would adversely affect the health and wellbeing of many NHS and health and social care staff. Also, I don’t think the test and trace system is a solution at this point in time either. The system is most effective in the early stages of a pandemic. As case numbers rise we need to become less reliant on the test and trace system and more reliant on social distancing and, in fact, full lockdown measures. The problem is the rate of infection rises beyond the capacity of the test and trace system quite quickly.
