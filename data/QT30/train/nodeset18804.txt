Jess Phillips[0:36:34] The Government only in 2018 allowed councils to borrow money to build social housing, which they had stopped in 2012, so, for that entire period, they had stopped councils being able to borrow money in order to build council housing, and it was only lifted a couple of years ago, and I have absolutely no idea why, other than it seems that what that does is give the whip hand to rich developers to be the only people in the market for house-building, and we can see from the Robert Genrik affair how powerful they actually are, sending chummy text messages talking about not giving money or dough, I believe was the term that was used, to the Marxists in Tower Hamlets, which of course means the children and the adults who would have used the hospitals and schools that that money would have gone to. So, yes, they absolutely need to be doing more. We all need to be doing more. I am sure that the minister on the panel will say we have done much more than the Labour Party ever did. It's a stock standard line. And, yes, do you know what? The Labour Party should have built more houses and so should this Government build considerably more houses that people can actually afford to live in.
