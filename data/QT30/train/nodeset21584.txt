Fiona Bruce[0:10:58] Why do you think that is? I'm not asking you to blow the government's trumpet here, but sensibly why do you think Scotland has succeeded there? In London, for example, just 23 percent of care homes have reached the target, four-fifths of staff.Ian Blackford[0:11:18] What you have in Scotland is a government at large which is trusted. One of the key factors over the course of the last 15 months has been the first minister, almost on a daily basis giving a press conference, giving information to the public as to what is going on, what is expected of people, giving guidance rather than putting things in statute where appropriate. Bringing people with us. We all talked about the success of the vaccine programme --Fiona Bruce[0:11:46] At a local level presumably things have been done differently.Ian Blackford[0:11:50] The point is we have communicated fairly with the public and the public in the main have come with us on that journey. A difficult journey for so many people.
