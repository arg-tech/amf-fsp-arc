Lisa Nandy[0:07:12] To answer your question very directly, what we've seen unfold in the last few months was not inevitable, it was a consequence, as Rory said, by a decision of the United States to withdraw, which left the UK in a difficult position, and I acknowledge and respect that the decision by Joe Biden to put a firm end date of the withdrawal obviously to motivate the Taliban and give them a signal they could advance across the country. It had a huge impact on the morale of the Afghan forces as well and undermined the efforts that had been made to try to strengthen their resilience. If I could say this too: our government had 18 months to prepare - 18 months ago - in Doha, there was an agreement that the US would be leaving, and Joe Biden has always made clear that he would respect that agreement. To see these scenes at the airport, to see the Defence Secretary saying that now because of our failure to plan, people will be left behind, and they will die, this is unacceptable, and it is an unparalleled moment of shame for this government.
