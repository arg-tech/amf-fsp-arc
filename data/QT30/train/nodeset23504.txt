[0:54:36] I'm not saying it can't be done because the point is in the long run, as has been said, you build a market for something so eventually, in theory, green technology could end up guaranteeing us not just abundant energy but also cheaper energy that's cleaner, cheaper than fossil fuels because it is on tap and it's renewable. So in the long run it will be great. But in the short term there is a cost. And it is to be borne by the consumer. I would remind people over the summer, before we even put our heating on, many people's -- my electric bill almost doubled. That's the cost that's going to be put on to the consumers. How do we bridge that gap? Here's an idea, let's ban private jets.

[0:55:30] I agree with Tim. I don't agree with much more that Tim said in the sense that there are political choices about where you put the cost for this transition. Clearly, you do not put that cost on people who are unable to pay it. So when you go back to the discussion about the insulating your home or putting the heat pumps in your home, what the government should have put in the strategy was government money. Governments borrow pretty cheaply right now and it needs to invest in order to reap rewards afterwards.
