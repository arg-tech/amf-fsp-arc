Fiona Bruce[00:26:57] I just want to hear from a couple more people in our audience before I move on. In our audience, it's confusing, we've got two Richards here, but Richard in our audience.
Richard Unknown[00:27:03] All these numbers, are we really talking about the right thing? Do we do this thing, do we do that thing? All it is is politicking. There's only really two numbers that are important here and that's jab one and jab two. When we had the first lockdown we had that and we saw the numbers decline, then we opened up a little bit, the numbers went up again. We had the second lockdown, the numbers declined, we opened it up again, the numbers went up again. We've had the third lockdown, the numbers declined. We've opened it up again and they've stayed declined, and that's because people are getting the two jabs in. My question to Nadhim would be we know that, we know that's the only thing that's really working here. What are you going to do to increase those numbers so that we can really all be safe?
