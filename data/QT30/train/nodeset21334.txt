[00:51:49] But over the UK government buildings?

Andrew RT Davies
[00:51:52] Well, the two flags fly proudly over the Welsh Office in Cardiff, the new Welsh Office that's just been built and so it should be mandated that both flags fly in Wales because we are a proud country on our own but also part of the United Kingdom soâ€¦

Fiona Bruce
[00:52:04] Why do you think this decision has been taken now? 

Andrew RT Davies
[00:52:06] Well, I think that question is probably directed at the Westminster government but ultimately they've taken the decision to obviously to fly that flag in England and across the United Kingdom because it unifies the whole country, it's an important symbol of unity in the United Kingdom, and I think it's an important recognition of the importance of a flag to a country's identity, and I'm proud to call myself a unionist but I'm equally proud to be a Welshman as well, a passionate Welshman who puts 19.5 stone on the veteran's rugby field every now and again.
