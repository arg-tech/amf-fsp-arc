AudienceMember 20210916QT11[0:17:54] The Government have made available the non-ACS fund. It's very limited in scope. It covers very specific types of cladding and the key thing is fire doesn't discriminate. It's a lot more than just cladding and there's a lot of fire safety defect that these buildings have. It's actually come out that basically these buildings haven't been fit for purpose for such a long time. It's now all coming out, and the Government don't seem to be willing to step-up and do the right thing, and actually protect people's lives because ultimately this is a safety issue. If I went out tomorrow and bought a toaster I would have more legal protection on that toaster than I have had on my biggest purchase that I have put my life savings into.
Fiona Bruce[0:18:36] What is the value at the moment?
AudienceMember 20210916QT12[0:18:40] Zero. This is the thing at the moment. I can't get a valuation on my home. Until the cladding is fixed and we have got an external survey which seems a long time off I'm going to be trapped here in a value-less home that I have put my life savings into.
Fiona Bruce[0:18:56] Anne-Marie, the Government has managed to get a bill through today, but talk to Natalie, it's not helping her?
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:19:02] So. First of all, you know, I think this has been such a big scandal and one that the Government has wanted to get to grips with you know, understand the extent of the challenges, and I think the fire safety bill that has gone through today as you say Fiona is the starting point and it's that commitment.
