Fiona Bruce[0:40:26] Just to be clear, so when you had -- you had the society of editors who had to resign after releasing a statement saying the British press is not racist. You had journalists of colour saying the depressingly reality of how blacks are portrayed on a daily basis is what was reflected by Megan's comments. Do you think that is not true? Do you think there isn't racism in the coverage?Dan Hodges[0:40:58] I don't think there's been racism of the coverage of Megan personally, no. I'm making a broader point. There is institutional racism in all forms across society. The argument that the British media is somehow exempt from this would be ridiculous.Fiona Bruce[0:41:18] You'll know these examples as well as anybody, but the example often quoted of Kate Middleton, of course -- they don't call her Kate Middleton these days, Kate tenderly cradles her baby. Then with Megan, "why can't she take her hands off her bump".Dan Hodges[0:41:48] That is not to me an example of racism. That is an example of what is part of our national obsession of playing minor royals off.Bonnie Greer[0:42:00] So you choose which Royal Family is the baddy and which is the goody.
