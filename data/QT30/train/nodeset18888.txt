Fiona Bruce[00:55:17] James, I promised I’d let you back in.James Cleverly[00:55:18] Yeah, thank you. I am not…and I would never suggest that there isn’t improvement that can be made, there’s a huge amount of improvement that can be made, but to imply that we’ve not progressed is just factually wrong and deeply insulting. Steve and I grew up in South East London and although he’s infinitely better looking, he’s a couple of years older, I remember when the National Front marched through my…the streets virtually where I live.Lisa Nandy[00:55:49] But society has progressed, James, but government isn’t matching that level of ambition.James Cleverly[00:55:52] That would never happen now. When I was first elected onto the London Assembly, I sat next to an elected member of the British National Party an explicitly racist political party, elected into London government by the voters of London. That would never happen now. When I was at school, I had no idea who Mary Seacole was and my mum was a black nurse. My parents started going out when being a mixed race couple would get you spat at in the street; that would never happen now. We have progressed so far. And there is yes, definitely definitely still room for improvement, but to deny the positive steps this country has made is deeply deeply deeply unfair.
