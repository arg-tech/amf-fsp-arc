AudienceMember 20210916QT21[0:42:12] I think there's you know, a huge moral imperative to help India. It's going through incredible pain, you know, sending 600 ventilators or pieces of hospital equipment is a drop in the ocean. The British Association of Physicians issued a statement saying we can do so much more. We have empty Nightingale hospitals, and we have huge ties as Jonathan said to India. I think it's a real shame that the argument keeps, we are trying to convince ourselves as a nation we have to do this to protect ourselves. We have to do this to protect thousands upon thousands of people dying every day in India.
Fiona Bruce[0:42:54] Tim?
Tim Stanley[0:42:58] I agree with part of that. I thought Jon had some very good points but subtly dodged the tricky question of what is the point at which you judge the country now has a surplus. Is it for instance once we have vaccinated everyone over the age of 42? Or the case that anything we are doing after that counts ethically as a surplus? That's a very difficult question to answer.
