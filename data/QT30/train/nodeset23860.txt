He has to reach out to and connect with and cut through to the country as a whole. I think there is a market for a left-of-centre party that can show how it will tackle the levelling up agenda, how it will help the left-behind, the left-out, the left-to-rot. In that sense it is very different from 1979 or even 2010 when people wanted government out of the way. People want a protective state and a Labour Party --

[0:28:18] Is it curtains for Keir? My more serious point is I thought I heard every type of letter used to describe recoveries and revision, but recently I have been hearing about K-shaped recovery. This means through COVID and through the pandemic and coming out of it it appears that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, as a huge generalisation, but it is very, very true. What we have seen is that schoolchildren, students, young people have been hammered by school closures, university closures and so forth, and industries in which young people work, the retail industry, the hospitality industry, have also been absolutely hammered by COVID and the recession. Who knows how many jobs will be lost in the end but it is almost exclusively in the younger part of the market, low-paid jobs.
