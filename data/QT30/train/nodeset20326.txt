Audience Member[0:43:10] I would like to know why the inquiry is taking so long. There's clearly more to this argument on both sides.Fiona Bruce[0:43:16] There is a date it has to report by. Jason.Audience Member[0:43:20] I think Iain touched on this already, but the concerns raised around the treatment of transsexuals in the party speak to sprinting as well.
Fiona Bruce[0:43:34] Well, the question is does the fallout between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon suggest that the party is divided?Michael Forsyth[0:43:40] There is a Civil War going on inside the SNP. You only have to look at the Twitter feeds to see that. I'm less concerned about that than what is happening to the standards of government in Scotland. When you have civil servants giving evidence under oath and having to come back to correct their testimony, when you're told that millions are spent on coaching them before giving evidence, something has gone very, very wrong with the government of Scotland. When the government votes 0 on two indications for information to be made to the inquiry and the first minister ignores it, something has gone very wrong.
