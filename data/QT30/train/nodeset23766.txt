Fiona Bruce[0:20:20] When Boris Johnson says no leaseholder should have to pay for the safety defects that they did not cause, you have Natalie there who is facing exactly that when it comes to perhaps not the cladding but other things like fire breaks, combustable balconies, sprinklers and did he just not mean it when he said that?Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:20:40] He did. And the fire safety bill is the first stage, and the fund to help get to grips with the complexity and enormity of this scandal that we have to help to unravel but, I don't for a moment deny this is a big challenge to deal with, and there's a huge amount of work to be done, both in you know, physical change, and working out where those challenges are. I hope you know very much that we will be able to support Natalie and many others in the weeks and months to come.Fiona Bruce[0:21:08] This is a fund you were keen to bring up?Daisy Cooper[0:21:10] The impact of the bill going through for people like Natalie and the hundreds of thousands of leaseholdsers is devastating. I was on the committee last summer I joined the committee that was scrutinising this piece of legislation. I introduced the principle that leaseholders should not have to pay for fire safety defects that are not of their making, and Liberal Democrats have stood with leaseholders from the very start to the very end and last night we were the ones who pushed the amendment again.
