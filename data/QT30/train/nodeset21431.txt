Suddenly Boris Johnson says no, Richi Sunac cuts the money. Now, for students, what I couldn't understand from all of this, last week I met a parent of a kid who, with his friends, jumped over the fence of his school so that they could get into school and do some activity over the weekend and use the facilities that they have. What does that say about Britain right now? We have students who are breaking into school because they want to be in school so much and the barrier is the government stopping them. We don't have a government which is matching the wishes that young people have for themselves right now. We have a government that has a catch phrase about levelling up. If levelling up is not about students and education. If levelling up is not about investing our people, then what is it for?
