Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:48:44] That's whatG AR VI's key role is.
Daisy Cooper[0:48:48] And you cut the -- programme
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:48:50] We put money in to do that to help G AR VI. In the countries where the Primary Care systems are not very robust that's where G AR VI has the incredibly effective way of help them.
Jon Ashworth[0:49:02] Cutting the aid budget
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:49:04] They need the vaccine. There wasn't the production capability that existed this time last year to be able to generate billions of doses and that's growing but we need to you know, keep at it!
Fiona Bruce[0:49:14] We have got time to get one more question in which I know the person who has asked it thinks is very important. I want to say a number of people have expressed interest. Kristina let's hear from you.
AudienceMember 20210916QT22[0:49:26] Thank you. Can there be any justification for the continued incarceration of people in care homes?
Fiona Bruce[0:49:34] Chris you have got a particular reason for asking this?
AudienceMember 20210916QT23[0:49:40] Yes. My late father's partner, a lady in her 80s is in a care home with Alzheimer's, and her daughter is allowed to visit her once a week for half an hour indoors, and no more. She's not allowed to go outside with her. She's not allowed to see her at any other time, and the care home says, oh well it's just too difficult to do, but I can't see why it should be so difficult to allow a daughter to come in, and this is you know, with testing, and with full PPE, and at no risk to the residents who are all being vaccinated. If this person was in prison, she would probably have more rights to have visitors than she does now.
