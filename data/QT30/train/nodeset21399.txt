Richard Walker[00:42:45] My buyers are telling me actually it won't be that cheap by the time it ends up on our shores.

Harriet Green[00:42:47] Indeed.

Richard Walker[00:42:48] Whilst it's very cheap to produce, when you add on the transportation costs actually our calculations are that it won't be so cheap at the end of it.

Fiona Bruce [00:42:57] Martin, let me come back to you. You're a dairy farmer not a beef and lamb farmer, but what's your view and that of other farmers that you're talking to?

Martin Unknown[00:43:08] I think, like Richard said, I spoke to some sheep farmers today to do some research on it and they were saying that really Australia are going to export to China. There's not a huge amount of product that actually hits our shore at the moment. They're not hitting their quotas that are actually available to them. And it's almost a bit of a falseâ€¦ I think the SNP have kind of stirred it up with the crofter debate and saying it was going to put other farms out of business. But a crofter is not competing on the mass market supermarket shelf.
