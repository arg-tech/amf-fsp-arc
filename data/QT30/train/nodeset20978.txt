Fiona Bruce[00:03:19] Yes, but they haven't done anything wild cat about independence.Keith Brown[00:03:21] Well, I think trying to stop parliament from meeting is pretty wild cat to me. And the simple fact is that the people who should decide if there's a referendum are the people of Scotland. So, I don't think for a second Boris Johnson will continue to refuse to agree a Section 20 agreement. And it will be an agreement, we're not pleading for that, we want to have that, it's the best way to have the referendum. But he will not stand in the way of a referendum in Scotland if the people in Scotland vote for it.
