Danny Sriskandarajah[0:15:32] A lot of commentators pose this as an either or issue. Government should be getting on with the crisis or we are distracted but we need both. We need urgent action on the issues that matter and we need transparency. This country we have had the Nolan principles for standards in public life for 25 years because it's a well established principle that you can't have a high functioning democracy without trust. And without transparency. For me, it's got to be both!
Fiona Bruce[0:16:00] OK.
Tim Stanley[0:16:00] We have that because the Electoral Commission is investigating that. I'm asking us pretty please not to pre-suppose that we know the answers. Also don't assume bad faith and the original plan was a blind trust that doesn't necessarily equal buying access. It is done in other countries.
Fiona Bruce[0:16:18] I am going to move on. We could talk about this for some considerable time. You have been sitting there quietly Anne-Marie.
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:16:26] I made the point and we have many ways to look at this and get the transparency.
Fiona Bruce[0:16:30] No less than
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:16:32] That's what we will have and then all know the answer.
Fiona Bruce[0:16:38] No less than three inquiries and let's hope we get the answer.
