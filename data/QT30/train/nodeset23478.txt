Fiona Bruce[0:20:56] Of course Owen Paterson has not been convicted of anything.
AudienceMember 20211111QT06[0:21:00] I think the MPs should only be dealing with their constituency issues, not taking on multiple roles. By taking on multiple roles it is saying the issues within their constituency is a part-time role. So I therefore have time to take payment from other companies. When you are elected into this particular role for your constituency, you act for them, them alone and nobody else.
Tim Stanley[0:21:28] Would you include things like being a firefighter or a GP? I think it can be a good thing that MPs can do things other than be an MP.
Caroline Lucas[0:21:40] The idea that you're going to have time to be putting in to doing another job on top of your work as an MP I think is for the birds. I think where you might be right is to have -- where you might be right is we could look at job-sharing for MPs. That is something I think would be positive. You get a wider selection of people putting themselves forward for that role, people who are carers or people who want to keep a foot in the door of being a GP or firefighter, whatever it is. But the idea you can find time for a part-time job that's going to pay you on top of being an MP I find preposterous.
