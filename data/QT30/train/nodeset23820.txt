Nelufar Hedayat[0:30:58] They're absolutely abiding by all those rules. It could be a front. I hope it isn't, because at the end of the day, the Afghan people will win. As a refugee to this country in 1994 from Afghanistan, when this country took me in - and it did, and it gave me schooling, which it did, and it sent me to university, and I got a job, and I worked here as a journalist, a person, as a woman, and a person of colour talking to all you guys - this is a privilege beyond my grandmother's wildest dreams and imaginations. As a journalist my job is to report on the stories, and that is what I do with the films I make and such. When we talk about refugees, it seems like a blob, a hoard, a mass of people - *a hoard, a mass of people, we have a right to do better in our lives. Those that are deserving, this is what we are it, and some that don't, as though the Taliban are somehow going to, under a burkha sneak their way into this country and do us harm. We need to be careful of those kinds of aspersions.
Fiona Bruce[0:32:00] Do you think there should be no limit?
Nelufar Hedayat[0:32:02] I think the British people should be in control of how much. Immigration and refugees should not be something that happens to us, that is done to the British people, it should be done with us. [Applause].
