Fiona Bruce[0:14:10] Jeremy, you wanted to come back in.
Jeremy King[0:14:16] I think it is a point well made. I think it is the cost, not just financially but on people. I think we have to put hospitality in perspective. Direct hospitality accounts for over 3 million employees in this country, we're the third highest employer. It's a regional spread of 11 percent of all employees are in the hospitality business. What's really significant for a really blighted generation is that 50 percent are in the age of 18 to 24. That's where all the redundancies are coming. We already lost 650,000 people from the catering industry in 2020. There's going to be at least another 350,000. The number of people like a powder keg sitting on a furlough. We're running the universal credit scheme on behalf of the government.
Fiona Bruce[0:15:18] Are you persuaded at all when you hear the scientists talk about the risk of indoor settings, the risk of infections ticking up as they did, slowly, but they did begin to tick up over the summer as indoor venues and hospitality began to open. Does that not give pause?
