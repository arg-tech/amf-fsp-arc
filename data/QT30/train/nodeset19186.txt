Sweden’s in trouble. They tried herd immunity. That’s what you’re talking about. And Sweden got in some trouble with that. The lady who spoke, I commiserate with her. I’ve been separated from my husband since February. We can’t be together. The same thing in the United States, we don’t have any leadership. We don’t have a leader. This isn’t some kind of thing you put on a graph and stand behind a podium and talk to people holding graphs up and charts. The only truth here is COVID. COVID is the truth. And then you move from there and we work to unite the country. We’re all in this together. We’re in this together. We’re not tiers and all of this, we’re together. So we need a leader who can talk to us together. The United States of America has 51 solutions running around there because the leadership refuses to take responsibility. We need a leader here.

Well, I mean, I agree once again. I think that the biggest problem is again…thinking about what Joe Biden was saying, he wants to shut down the virus but not necessarily the economy, and so if you just went to the protocol and standards in South Korea who had experience with MERS and SARS and we just copied their best practices we would be well on our way, whether it’s the United Kingdom or the United States. I’ll just point out, South Korea, 20 deaths per million on a per capita basis. United States 620 deaths per million. I know the United Kingdom is suffering alongside the United States. So to me it’s very simple. We have a tendency for myopia, we have a tendency to think that our Anglo Saxon way of doing things is a priority, but I think we should be copying the South Koreans right now and adopting their practices and then you will see both of our economies flourish.
