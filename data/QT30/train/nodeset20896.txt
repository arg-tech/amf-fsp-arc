Nigel Owens[00:49:55] I just hope that all the leaders of all the parties will be very honest and upfront in their policies, honest and upfront with young people who at 16 and 17 years of age can be heavily influenced at that age. Fifty is the new 40, I think 16 is the new 18, times have changed, you have the influence of social media and stuff as well on young people. There are a huge amount of very, very sensible mature 16 and 17-year-olds out there, and politics should be for all. All of us should have a say in our own country and the future of our country, at 16, 17 years of age as well, as well as 18 and upwards. So I really hope that young people will engage more in the political debate and will cast their vote in May, and I hope that it will be for the right reasons, that we don't get any populism and weighing in young people that, you know, the genuine policies are there for young people to decide who they believe is going to be the best party to lead them.
