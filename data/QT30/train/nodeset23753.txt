David Lammy[0:54:05] …a whole set of things have been missed, and so for that reason, it does seem likely that because people couldn't sit in front of their GP, you know, your GP knows you, he knows your family over many years, can ask the right questions. That can't all be done online, it can't all be done on the phone, that seems obvious to me, but it's not as straightforward as just being able to get back to see your GP if you can't see your GP for four to six weeks, and for some practices, that was the case.
