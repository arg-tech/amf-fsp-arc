Fiona Bruce[00:47:02] Devi.
Professor Devi Sridhar [00:47:04] Yeah, and this also comes into a public health issue, because part of the reason that the UK was hit so hard with COVID-19 was because we had a public health problem. A lot of people weren't in the best physical condition because of unhealthy diet. And why is that? Because it's really expensive to eat well and to eat local and to eat vegetables and have fresh meat. So for me looking at this issue it should be actually how do we look at our food ecosystem right now in Britain and say how do we make it easier for people to make healthy and affordable choices so that in the next pandemic we can come out of this looking much better instead of revealing all the inequalities that we have already in terms of what you can access based on what is available and what it costs.
