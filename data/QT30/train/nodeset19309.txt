[Coleen]: Scientists and regulators have done an amazing job at getting the Pfizer vaccine developed, approved and off the starting blocks. Will they and the general public now be let down at the final hurdle by our logistics capabilities? 

Fiona Bruce [00:02:42] Sarah?

Sarah Jones [00:02:46] That’s the question everyone is asking at the moment. It is fantastic news that we’ve got the vaccine. It really is a moment to be proud, to be proud of all the scientists across the world working on all these vaccines and to have that light at the end of tunnel, when you are putting up your Christmas decorations you can think there will be an end to this because the vaccine is coming. It is brilliant. We know, and the scientists have been clear in the press conference with the prime minister, this is going to be very challenging logistically. Firstly, how is it going to be delivered and to whom. Of course, there are tiers of people that are going to get it first. But I don’t know about you, but my MP WhatsApp groups have been buzzing all day with people saying we heard there’s going to be a hospital here doing it, a hospital there, but what about our area?
