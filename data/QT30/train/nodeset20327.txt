Ian Murray[0:40:48] Nicola Sturgeon had a meeting with the former first minister in the house of the chief executive of the SNP who happens to be married to the current first minister, and nobody mentioned what they were talking about. This is a cesspit that has to be resolved for two reasons. It is bringing democratic structures in Scotland into disrespect, and, secondly, there is women involved here who were brave to come forward and it is all being swept under the carpet. It is a disgraceful thing that's happened and it is a disgraceful thing what's happened to Joanna Here. She has done her home affairs brief, I worked closely with her during the Brexit, cast aside from the SNP for having a different view. That's the kind of party we have running Scotland at the moment. It is undermining our democracy. Until we get to the truth we will never know what the problem has been. Nicola Sturgeon still refuses to answer the question.Fiona Bruce[0:41:48] Let me restate obviously Alex Salmond was acquitted and Nicola Sturgeon denies misleading Parliament.
