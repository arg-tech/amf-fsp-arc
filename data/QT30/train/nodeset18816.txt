Fiona Bruce[0:44:54] Steve?
Steve Barclay[0:44:56] Well, we need to build build build. I think immediately that means getting construction sites up and running. We have been supporting the construction industry through the managers we have taken. Planning is still an impediment to the pace at which we want to move. So we are planning to look at that in legislation and see what we can do to speed that up.
Fiona Bruce[0:45:16] We are doing significantly more already and we have made very big investments into that in the budget as well. But I think it's also, looking about how we build better. Because one of the things I am very pass net about is modern moths of construction, looking about how we build, where we assemble on site change the energy usage is much lower. So we can build has committed significant funds to this. In response to Granfel Tower, in particular, we committed in the /PWUPLGT additional funding to that as well. Some of those schemes have been slowed down because of Covid and the difficulty of actually doing work on that. I was talking about one of Jess's colleagues labour MP about that just yesterday. But we have committed funding to that. We are committed to build and one of the key things we can do now is get construction up and running so that industry can bounce back as quickly as possible.
