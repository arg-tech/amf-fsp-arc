Fiona Bruce[00:54:51] In terms of the role of the UK government, you think about the ceasefire that was brokered in 2014, Egypt played a major role in that. There was the Oslo channel many years previously. What can the UK actually be doing meaningfully to try and bring together some kind of understanding in the Middle East, in Israel and Palestine particularly?
Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:55:09] Well, the UK does have diplomatic weight around the world that it can use. I think the scenes we've seen over recent days have been awful and distressing, seeing the consequences of the Hamas rockets that have been fired into Israel and the consequence of the Israeli air strikes in Gaza, the schools, the hospitals, hundreds of civilians dead and so many children has been truly terrible.
