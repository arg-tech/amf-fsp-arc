Jeremy King[0:15:38] The government figures showed absolutely the opposite. We have seen .005 percent infection among customers. The government, the ONS have produced the figures themselves. The infection rate is very, very low in these situations. I don't understand, also, this idea that being outside suddenly you are safe. You are less vulnerable, perhaps, but you are not safe. I walked through Soho where people are sitting cheek by jowl shouting at each other in the noise. This is not safe. COVID does not respect the fact that you are outside. There's a much greater facet to it is how close you are to people. Also, the practicality of it. I do despair sometimes that nobody in the government has worked in the hospitality industry and that this is all committee decisions. My feeling about committees, I love the old saying that a camel is a horse designed by a committee. You sort of get there in the end, which is what we are doing, but it could have been a lot better.
