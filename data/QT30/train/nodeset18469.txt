Fiona Bruce [00:13:54] So, Vaughan, I mean this just leads on really from Tessa’s question, whether or not taking the statues down is productive, I don’t know whether you approved of what happened in Bristol, and is it perhaps obscuring a larger, or helping a larger discussion?Vaughan Gething [00:14:16] Well, I’m pleased that John’s made his point in his question, because what I was going to say to the original question was, that yes, I do think that some of those statues need to come down, and others that stay up, I think need greater context about who those figures were. But the Black Lives Matter campaign is not a campaign to re-engineer our public space and remove statues, it’s actually not even about the death of George Floyd, it’s about the persistent and continuing racial inequalities, that affect not just America but other countries around the world, including our own. And that’s the point. And I think within that, this is only one small part of a debate that we need to have as a group of countries, but then also an action that we need to take. And all of us are painfully familiar with the fact that criminal justice [inaudible 00:15:02] different, if you like me compared to Robert. They’re different in terms of what happens to you in terms of mental health services too. That’s the sort of action that I think we need to see taken, and get too led down a blind alley here.
