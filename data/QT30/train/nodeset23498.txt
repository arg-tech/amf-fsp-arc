Emily Thornberry[0:44:06] I think in order to assist whether COP is going to be a success, we need to look at other commitments that the countries are making enough and will they stick to them. As the gentleman in the blue jacket was saying, I agree with you. I do worry that sometimes -- well, we saw it, we saw it, frankly -- I went to the Copenhagen summit. There was Â£100 billion supposed to be committed by the developed world to the developing world to help them develop in a green way and be able to protect themselves against the effects of climate change. They haven't seen that money. So I worry there are countries going we'll be zero by 2070. There isn't a plan -- a proper plan as to how they are going to get there. And it doesn't really -- I mean, it is great now people are starting to say we want to get to net zero. That's different to what they said before. They were saying before they didn't need to do it. But we need a proper plan showing how we're going to get there, how much carbon are they going to produce in the meantime. Because the truth is, in order to stick to make sure our planet doesn't heat up more than 1.5 degrees we need to half the amount of carbon we are producing by the end of this decade. Now, how are we going to do that?
