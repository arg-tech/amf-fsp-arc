[0:14:00] Sorry you are levelling allegations which we haven't got to yet because we still don't know the answer to the question of who originally paid for it. If there's a suggestion, if there's a suggestion and there's an uncomfortable relationship between private capital, and the Government, that has gotten worse in the past year, I don't disagree with you. It's a function of the lockdown, it's a function of our pandemic response and the amount of money that we have spent of which there has been no control because Britain has taken the attitude of we will spend whatever it takes in order to procure the medical equipment and vaccines to give you one example. In the course of pursuing Test &amp; Trace the Government signed over 600 contracts and with over 2,000 consultants one of which charged 6, 000 plus per day. Britain has been leaking money for the last year. That's worth talking about! That's worth an inquiry. How much the Prime Minister personally paid for his wallpaper is a distraction.

[0:14:58] But who paid for it. Who made the donation is not a distraction. It is not a distraction. There's a reason why politicians have to declare donations, have to declare loans because people need to see that we are acting in the public interest, not in the particular interest of the donors and those who are funding our lifestyles, so it is not a distraction, it's about integrity and honesty in politics and I still think that's worth fighting for.
