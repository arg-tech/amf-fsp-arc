Fiona Bruce[0:08:26] Mehdi, let's hear the view from Washington.
Mehdi Hasan[0:08:30] I think the answer to the question why was there no exit strategy is because we were lied to. I mean, we were lied to from the very beginning. We were always told that Afghanistan was the good war, and Iraq was the bad war. You know what? Afghanistan had its own share of lies. We were told there was no alternative to going to war, even though it was reported at the time that the Taliban were willing to hand over bin Laden to a third country if Bush offered proof. Bush said no. The Taliban in 2001 offered to surrender as long as their leaders were kept safe in Kandahar, Donald Rumsfeld no, unconditional surrender. How did that work out? For 20 years, Obama, Trump, Blair, Brown, Cameron, May, Johnson - all lied to us. 20 years with turning the corner, "We're going to win, it's going well. Democracy's coming. The Taliban are on the run." What do we get for 20 years? 457 UK dead, 2,488 American dead, 47 Afghan dead civilians, 69 Afghans and police officers. At what point do we say enough is enough? We have to end this, but it has to end. I don't accept for region nationality. South Korea, we've not been experiencing a 20-year armed insurgency. We cannot have endless war mongering. Doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.
