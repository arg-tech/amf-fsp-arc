Keith Brown [00:17:57] And look at the Tories â€“ they had the pandemic to deal with and they had Brexit and they went and pushed through a hard Brexit in the teeth of the pandemic. So, I'll take no lessons from Douglas Ross about trying to do two things at once.
Anas Answar [00:18:07] What about the things which you're losing?
Fiona Bruce [00:18:08] But do you think they did both those things well, then?
Keith Brown [00:18:10] No, I think it was appalling.
Fiona Bruce [00:18:12] Right, okay.
Keith Brown [00:18:10] And if you go back to the point that was made about the question of Brexit, in the referendum of 2014 we were told the only way to guarantee Scotland's place in the EU was to vote no. Well, people voted no and it's been changed, we're being dragged out of the EU against our will. But that's also one of the routes that we can have back to prosperity, a more equal and just country, if we get back into the EU and with the powers of on independent country.
Anas Sarwar [00:18:34] But Keith, let's go back to talking about what you do have the power over. Willie mentioned drugs deaths. How many times during this pandemic has someone picked up the phone to call the crisis mental health service and the call's gone unanswered?
