Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:25:54] Yes, the government made a profound error by not adding India to the red list on 9 April with Pakistan and Bangladesh. Nadhim gave an explanation of a variant. That's the second different explanation I've heard from government ministers this week. The Health Secretary is claiming it's because the positivity rate in Pakistan was three times that of India, which the evidence doesn't bear out in any way, and won't even tell us what the source of that data is. It isn't something that was said later on. People were saying it at the time. I questioned it at the time, as did many, many others. It wasn't until 19 April, that's the point at which the Prime Minister cancelled that scheduled trip to India that was due on the 25th, then India was added on the red list on the 23rd. In those 14 days, by the way, from the 9th to the 23rd we think around about 20,000 arrivals from Indiaâ€¦ It was a blunder of the first magnitude. India should have been added to the red list on the 9th.
