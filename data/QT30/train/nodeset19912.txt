Fiona Bruce[00:52:58] When you hear businesses talking about the reams of paperwork, saying it is a full time job to deal with the new paperwork, much more than they had before, do you feel from your knowledge of the Brexit process that that is something we would be able to put behind us and we’ll get sorted out or it will continue to be a thorn in the sides of some companies?Anand Menon[00:53:18] It will vary on the firms. Some will deal with it, keep on trading. Other firms, small businesses, might struggle more because of the load placed upon them. We shouldn’t kid ourselves that Brexit means trade will continue as it did before. It won’t. It will change. That doesn’t mean that the protocol can’t be made to work for Northern Ireland. It means that government and businesses need to work together to ensure that it functions as well as it possibly can.
