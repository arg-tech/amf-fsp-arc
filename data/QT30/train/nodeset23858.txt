AudienceMember 20210819QT15[0:24:22] I think one of the problems is that there is a lot of infighting in the Labour Party. I would like to see a party that can give some proper vision, some proper ideas of how we're going to come out of the pandemic. Not lots and lots and lots of empty promises to try to buy seats but to try to make peoples lives better. Really, was it sensible to have somebody who was a remainer to be standing in from somewhere which was very much keen on leaving the EU? I think that was a big mistake.

AudienceMember 20210819QT16[0:24:56] I think we underestimate how difficult it has to be for any opposition leader to get themselves heard while we're going through the pandemic and coming out of it. To judge anyone at this time. You have to give him a couple of years.
John Bercow[0:25:18] I think people like straight answers. Although we haven't seen the outcome, I am very confident from what I've read that Labour will lose Hartlepool. Yes, that is a shock. It wasn't originally to be expected. It isn't really a shock to me, and the reason why it isn't a shock to me is that it is only 17 months ago that the red wall seats revoted against Labour and turned to the Conservatives.
