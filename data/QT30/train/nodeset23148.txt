[00:38:30] I think it's a one-time windfall tax would be reasonable to help the country recover. But we would also, you know, expect the wealthy to pay more. We've got to rebalance the inequalities in our society. 

Fiona Bruce
[00:38:45] So you want to raise taxes, okay. Debbie?

Debbie Unknown
[00:38:48] Hi there, good evening. I'm just wondering how the Green Party can justify the increase through taxation when part of their manifesto is looking towards moving to a four-day working week. Surely, people need to earn more money to raise additional taxation.

Lorna Slater
[00:39:10] That is an excellent question and thank you very much for asking it. So, the kind of taxes that we're looking at are windfall taxes on massive corporations and, for example, a wealth tax on people who have assets of over a million pounds.

Fiona Bruce 
[00:39:22] So, again, this is the tax that you have to get the governmentâ€¦the UK government to agree to hand over to you, but at the moment you don't have that power.
