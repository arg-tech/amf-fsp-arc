AudienceMember 20210708QT11[0:38:50] I'm anticipating that come September I will have the flu vaccine in one arm, the COVID in the other arm, and get on with this. If I want to wear a mask, I'll wear a mask. Let people make the decision. If you feel comfortable wearing the mask, wear it. If you feel you have been vaccinated, get on with our lives. That's what we need to do.Fiona Bruce[0:39:16] One more before I move on.AudienceMember 20210708QT12[0:39:20] I think the key thing for me is, if we want our lives back, if we want to have in-person studying and we want to have in-person socialising, we need to understand we can't go backwards. We can't go back to how it was before. As you've already said, that's what got us here. So, if I have to wear a mask to protect people that I want to interact with, because the mask doesn't protect me, it stops me from spitting all over someone else, I should do that. The same way as I should drive my car and not smash into people, I should wear a mask to not give them a disease. If that's what it takes to get the country back to normal, to get in-person teaching back to normal, to get small businesses, to get the hospitality industry, to get performing arts, to get everybody back to normal, if we wear a mask, that's not really a Big Brother state, that's just me saying -- and everybody saying -- oh, I'm not actually going to spit all over you today.
