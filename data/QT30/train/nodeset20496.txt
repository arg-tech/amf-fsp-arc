Audience Member 5[0:13:04] Look, I think Grant is fine saying what he said. He has not really answered my question. I have six seats on a kerb. I don't have a sprawling Mediterranean terrace. I'm sick of waiting one or two days for Richi Sunac to announce the right thing, now I have to wait a week. That anxiety is unfair. We shouldn't have to wait for a budget. The Panel have said things I agree with. I want the correct support between now and when I'm supposed to open. You know, why do my one-off grants have to last me longer than the retail sector, yet they have opened first both times? Okay, someone could chime in and say I've had a VAT cut. 15 percent VAT saving on zero turnover. It is zero savings. Extend it now in good faith. Where's my job retention bonus? I already spent it, and I spent it paying my team.
