Anand Menon[00:52:16] You have to accept the fact that the Brexit process led to a significant rethink of the UK union not just in Northern Ireland; you see the same process happening in Scotland. So that just seems to be the reality at the moment. For me the priority at the moment is, yes, obviously people should plan because we are living in an uncertain time where public opinion seems to be very volatile. But surely it is to make the protocol work. We are where we are. We have a new settlement for Northern Ireland and while it is legitimate to think about the future I would hate it if because of that we lost sight of the present and didn’t take the opportunity to make that protocol work as effectively as it can.[DONE]
