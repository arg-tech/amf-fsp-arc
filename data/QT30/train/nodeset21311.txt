Dave Unknown[00:45:46] Thank you, Fiona. Yeah, it's an interesting dilemma. Ultimately, one of my thoughts is is this the backdoor approach to a national ID card system? I don't know. The other aspect is, yes, there is a possibility that votes are rigged, we know that, that is a strong possibility. My main concern realistically with the ID system is like anything else it is open to abuse, and because it's open to abuse it can lead to unfortunately the wrong direction in which the government wants to go.
Fiona Bruce[00:46:28] Okay. Molly, you asked the question.
Molly Unknown[00:46:31] I think the main issue is what lines you draw up, what type of IDs are acceptable. Because there was a trial run and they turned away people with like student cards, bus passes issued by the councils, and then none of them turned back up with correct ID. So you're just going to start discrimination against the electorate, which is a very dangerous road.
Fiona Bruce[00:46:54] Michelle, are you in favour?
Michelle Dewberry[00:46:56] Yeah, to me this is very simple. If I want to go and get a letter from my post office, I've got to show that I am who I say I am on that letter. I amâ€¦
Fiona Bruce[00:47:04] But not with photo ID, that's the critical difference.
