Fiona Bruce [00:03:30] Diane’s question is very pointed. Who is managing it better? David Ross [00:03:36] I don’t think you can treat this as a competition. When people continue to lose their lines of business, when people continue to be infected at an alarming rate. But we have to look across the UK there has been a similar approach taken by all four governments. Around the world we are a stranger about this virus, a virus that didn’t exist this time last year. But there have been big mistakes in Scotland and we have to accept that and listen to the advice we are hearing and learn from them. In Scotland we had people testing positive for Covid-19 in a hospital being discharged into a care home. We have to learn from that. Nicola Sturgeon told us there would be a support in September; we’re still waiting in October for that. We have the highest percentage of deaths in the care home setting anywhere in the UK here in Scotland. So no one can claim a success. It is a battle that we are all still fighting. It is one that continues to take lives. It is one we are still trying to get on top of. That’s just the health battle. We also have the economic response to deal with as well.
