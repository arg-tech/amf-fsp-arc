[0:00:44] I'm quite against it, to be honest. It should be a different strategy. I think people should be encouraged to have vaccinations. Like many people from the BMA community I have a vaccine hesitancy in order to overcome to have the vaccine, to be fair, to be convinced about it, I had to think about it quite a lot. That's as someone who is in the NHS. I think if you look at, you know, over 20% of NHS workers come from BAME communities. If you try to mandate these things you will have people who are vaccine-hesitant become vaccine -- so I think you make the problem worse.
