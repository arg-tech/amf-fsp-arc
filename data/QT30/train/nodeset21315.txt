Paul Mason[00:41:45] So I see this, what is this, it's straight out of the Donald Trump playbook, this is being done in Texas, it's being done in Georgia, it's being done by the American right, right now, you suppress the vote of people who are unlikely to vote. Who's unlikely to vote if you have voter ID? Eleven million people, right. Who are they? Poor people, black people, refugees. It's the people that the Tories don't want to vote for Labour. So I think, Robert, you've got to answer this, is it even…what's the legality, what's the principle behind suppressing the votes of the British people just to get Boris Johnson another four years on his red velveteen settee?
Robert Buckland[00:42:42] You've got to ask your own party, Paul, why they did it in Northern Ireland in 2003. There's been no evidence at all that the introduction of voter ID in Northern Ireland has done any of the things you've said.
Fiona Bruce[00:42:52] So why are you introducing it? Why do you want it introducing?
Robert Buckland[00:42:53] I think it's important that…in our society there are people undertaking normal transactions that absolutely accept the point that with regard to specific transactions a form of ID is a normal thing. Now, can I say, I'm very much against a general ID card policy. I don't believe in it, never have done, I've campaigned hard against it ten years ago.
