[0:44:32] For my generation who talk a good game on altruism, we could say Britain has a moral responsibility to protect its own who are vulnerable, but beyond that point the moral locus shifts to protecting people who are vulnerable overseas. I agree very strongly with the point that this shouldn't be a debate about what is best for Britain. It is simply what is the right thing to do. I think that would be the right thing to do.

[0:45:02] OK.

Danny Sriskandarajah
[0:45:04] I think Tim is right. One of the amazing things we have seen at Oxfam, and many of the other charities that are working internationally is the generosity of the British people who are coming into the appeal for India. The original question was what more could the Government be doing, our Government is cutting aid, yesterday we found out amongst the cuts will be an 80% reduction in funding for clean water and hygiene around the world. It beggars belief at the time of a global pandemic when there's more people in need of assistance since the Second World War, our second is cutting funding for clean water and hygiene, I can't understand that.
