Fiona Bruce [00:23:30] Individual countries can approve emergency powers even within the EU. Liam Halligan [00:23:36] They can in principle, but they agreed between them not to do that. That’s just factually accurate. That’s what it is. What I didn’t like, the European Medical Agency again, yesterday, Mr Gavin Williams’s comments, which I agree were completely crass and if it were a joke it went badly wrong, the European Medical Agency yesterday was casting aspersions on our regulatory testing regime when the WHO has described as world class. It is not a nationalistic thing to say, it is just a point of fact. Once you get into this folly of different parts of the world, politicians chest-beating saying our regulations are better than your regulations, as people with public platforms, scientists, journalists, we have a big responsibility here. Quite a lot of our population, and maybe we’ll come on to this, is concerned about taking the vaccine, a smaller proportion here than in our European countries and across the world. We don’t want to get into a Dutch auction of whose regulator is better. We did do the phase 1, 2 and 3 tests here. The Chinese and Russians are rolling out vaccines before they do the phase 3 tests. It was good to hear from Peter, and indeed from our audience, why it is we’ve managed to truncate this by doing different things in parallel. Vaccines take years, but you are trying to generate funding. We obviously don’t have that. I would like to do so us getting beyond this vaccine nationalism, which I think Gavin’s comments played into. We’ve all had enough of this virus around the world. We want to see our leaders getting on, supporting each other, calling out regulatory slips where we can see them happening, but supporting each other when we can see that responsible regulatory bodies are doing their job, whoever gets there first.
