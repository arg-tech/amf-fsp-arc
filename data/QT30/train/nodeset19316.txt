Fiona Bruce [00:06:42] Are we going to be let down by logistics capabilities? Michelle Donelan [00:06:46] No. I can totally understand why people are concerned and nervous at this stage. We’ve got this far, it is good news. But we made it very clear as a government this is a massive logistical challenge, but one that our NHS is up to, the same NHS that got us through this pandemic. Fantastic people, including in my own constituency that worked tirelessly to support us. We have a plan, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it together, but this isn’t going to happen overnight. We need to be realistic about that. To be successful we need to green-light other vaccinations. This is the first one. It depends on the manufacture of these vaccinations. So it is out of our control as well. It is a long process. Hope and help is here, but there’s a long way to go.[DONE]
