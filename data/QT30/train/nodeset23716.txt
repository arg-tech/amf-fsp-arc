Fiona Bruce[0:17:01] Okay.Grant Shapps[0:17:02] â€¦and the COVID support, 407 billion pounds so far, I think everyone appreciates that we have to pay for it somehow, and it can't go on ad infinitum as we move out of this period.Fiona Bruce[0:17:13] Alright, I'm going to move on, take another question, but before I do, I just want to tell you that next week we'll be in Birmingham, with Wes Streeting from Labour, and the former inhabitee of Love Island, Amy Hart. The following week, which is the 7th October, we'll be in Aldershot and comedian Rosie Jones will be on the panel, so if you live in either Birmingham or Aldershot, I cannot tell you how exciting it is to be doing a shout out for an audience, we haven't done it for a year and a half. If you live there or in the surrounding area, do come along and join us. You can go to the Question Time website and be part of the audience and we would love to hear from you. Right, let's take another question which is from Brian, Brian Stacey.
