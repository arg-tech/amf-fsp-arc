Fiona Bruce[0:56:02] He said it twice.
Mark Harper[0:56:06] On the general point, last year when he went to Barnard Castle. I said to the Prime Minister he should resign and if he didn't, the Prime Minister should sack him. If the Prime Minister reflects on that advice he probably wishes he takes it and sacked Dominic Cummings last year.
Daniel Finkelstein[0:56:28] For all of his great intelligence and ability, I think we are much better off without him in the government. I think it did create chaos. He pointed to a lot of mistakes the government made. We have to learn from those but he pursued a personal vendetta against Matt Hancock.
