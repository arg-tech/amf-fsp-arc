Fiona Bruce[0:00:00] We'll take our first question now, which is Becky.

AudienceMember 20210708QT01[0:00:06] Thank you, Fiona. Welcome, Panel. Was Boris's nonaction against Matt Hancock yet another missed opportunity to show leadership and set the standard for social distancing?

David Davis[0:00:20] I don't think so. With all these things, when somebody falls from grace there's almost a lynch mob in the press. I watched this, I thought it was plain that Matt was going to go. But Boris made a number of decisions. I'm just reading his mind the same way you would.
