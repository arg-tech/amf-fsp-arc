Fiona Bruce[0:39:10] Jo.
Jo Grady[0:39:16] I don't understand why we are making excuses for Matt Hancock's willful amnesia or willful misremembering of what happened last year. There was insufficient PPE in hospitals. There was frequently the adoption of a two-tier system who got it, there were surgeons, care workers, nurses, reusing PPE. There were examples of hospitals using PPE ten years out of date. Some of the lowest paid, insecurely paid people, literally the ones holding iPads while we had to watch our loved ones on Zoom not having access to PPE. The idea we are all taken by surprise, couldn't accommodate this, when that is years and decades of underfunding of our NHS is an insult to anybody who provides care who works in that sector or associated industries. It would be so much nicer if we could just apologise to those people, acknowledge what happened, and not give contracts to our mates who don't have any experience in providing PPE. That would be a great start.
Fiona Bruce[0:40:20] Okay. Obviously the government denies that is in fact what happened in terms of contracts.
