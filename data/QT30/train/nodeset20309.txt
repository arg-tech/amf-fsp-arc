Michael Forsyth[0:21:50] If you look at the record on health and elsewhere, I find it extraordinary, in the middle of a pandemic, when we have all the consequences in terms of lost jobs and the rest that people should be thinking that we should divide our country instead of putting together the damage which has been done by this virus, getting our economy growing again in order to pay down the debt and to pay jobs. I find it utterly unbelievable. And Scotland, Scotland is not the SNP. The Scottish Nationalist Party shouldn't take the electorate for granted and assume they are going to get a majority. They should concentrate on health and education.
Jeane Freeman[0:22:32] We are not insisting or taking for granted we would get a majority at all. It is curious, Michael, that actually the people in Scotland who are talking -- political parties who are talking most about independence are your own and Labour. What we're talking about is a pandemic and how you rebuild Scotland. And our view is if there is a majority in the next Parliamentary election on 6 May, 21 polls in a row, people saying that they want to be independent, but the Scottish people, the basic fact here is the people in Scotland have the right to choose whether or not they want to have a referendum.
