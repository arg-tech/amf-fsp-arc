Fiona Bruce [00:47:43] Sure, but what about the third that Shakeel is referring to?
Robert Buckland [00:47:45] Well, look, I think he’s right to draw our attention to the fact that they’re still people who are not cooperating. I think it’s…
Fiona Bruce [00:47:52] And why do you think that is?
Robert Buckland [00:47:53] Well, I’m concerned about that. I think it’s all of our collective duty to work with the authorities, to do everything we can to do our part, and clearly we’ve got to get the message over again and again, about the importance of sharing that information, and we share it in a voluntary way, but we do it in a spirit of collective coming together to fight this virus. I think this is only the first week, but I think the figures are encouraging.
Fiona Bruce [00:48:20] I know, I just mention it simply because, some minutes that came out from SAGE, which of course is the scientific body advising the government, say that 80 per cent of contacts need to be traced, in order for this system to be effective. And if a third of the people aren’t handing over their contacts at all, you’re not going to get anywhere near that are you?
