Audience Member 20211028QT13[00:17:02] What is being done to protect women with the reported increase of spiking, including by injection, across Scotland the UK?
Fiona Bruce[00:17:10] So this isâ€¦ Ingrid, you're referring to a number of reports that have come, certainly from Scotland, and across other parts of the UK. I'm thinking of Nottingham and Leeds, where women are reporting having been spiked with needles in nightclubs and then blacking out. Also women have reported having their drinks spiked, so tampered with before that. Is this something that's worrying you, Ingrid?
Audience Member 20211028QT14 [00:17:33] I have genuinely never felt more unsafe to be a woman going out and about. I've always been a bit worried about getting my drink spiked, but I just don't think that anyone would look after me if it did, like staff members and bouncers in particular. They just seem to take you out of the club and get you a bit far enough away and leave you.
Fiona Bruce[00:17:56] Or they just think you're drunk and get you out.
Audience Member 20211028QT15 [00:17:59] Yeah.
