Audience Member 2[0:01:48] Ultimately I want parity in the rules and fairness. I don't mind if we wait until August, what I want is support and I want to understand there's some fairness, some parity. As an industry, I have to wait for Rishi in that case to come out, now I have to wait for the budget. That's not fair. Ultimately we want fairness, parity, we want a clear message. I think Boris Johnson missed the chance to open the industry early, do it with that support, that safety and that thing that we'll do, we'll manage that outside for him. He's missed a trick.

Fiona Bruce[0:02:28] He's missed a trick, Grant.
