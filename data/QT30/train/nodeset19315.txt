Fiona Bruce [00:12:44] Lawrence? 
[Lawrence]: No doubt it is absolutely brilliant news, but this is an international problem. Bath is very much a tourism city. So I would like to know what the follow-up to this is. As we start becoming vaccinated, the rest of the world becomes vaccinated, is there some sort of passport system that will be introduced so we can start travelling abroad and tourists can start travelling back into the UK that have been vaccinated? 
Fiona Bruce [00:13:14] Michelle, let me ask you about that. The question about is Brexit going to slow down the import of the vaccine into this, then talk of an immunity passport which was hinted at, then dismissed by Michael Gove. 
Michelle Donelan [00:13:30] As a government weâ€™ve not got plans to introduce a passport or anything like that, of that nature. Of course, businesses may look to do that in the future, but the key thing here needs to be promoting the vaccine and getting the rest of those vaccines green lit so we can start the roll-out properly and effectively.
