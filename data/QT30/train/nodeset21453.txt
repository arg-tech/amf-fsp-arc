[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : I agree with the point that we should follow the data rather than the dates, but impossible for people and businesses to figure out when we are going to be able to open up. You can't not have a day to work towards. I also think that with the amount of people that have been vaccinated with how long this has been going on, with the impact on children's mental health and on the economy in general that at some point we do need to, you know, draw some kind of line under this and say we have to accept this is another disease among all of the other diseases that we have to deal with. I am sympathetic to the view we need to unlock, we need to have our people vaccinated, which they are. We need to be clear -- I do agree with the Labour person, we need to be clear what is red and what is green. Portugal is on the amber list. I have no idea what that means for me personally. As an NHS employee, I imagine I can't travel. It would be easier if people knew what they can and can't do rather than what they may be able to do. To me we need a date. I think we need to have a balance between the economy and trying to save every single person going hospital.
