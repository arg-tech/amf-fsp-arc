Yes, the woman there in the black and white skirt.Audience Member 20211028QT05[00:11:20] Hi, I hear what you're saying about the vaccines and about masks are trying to prevent getting COVID. However, at the moment many people have COVID. They're phoning 111, they're phoning their GP, the GP's saying phone 111. They're on the phone for at least an hour to get through to a numerous people while they're ill on the phone. The services at the moment are not fit for purpose, they're not set up. People are waiting outside to get into hospitals. It really is a bad time at the moment if you have COVID. So what is the government doing knowing that we're actually going to get worse, because we're not set up?Fiona Bruce[00:11:58] The man in the stripy top with the glasses.Audience Member 20211028QT06[00:12:00] Do you think having 30,000 people descending Glasgow for COP26 is the right thing to do in this situation?Fiona Bruce[00:12:07]The woman in the red sweater.
