Kate Forbes[00:07:40] And I think the gentleman makes a really important point. We are about to go into winter, it's pretty cold already, we are seeing the fact that the NHS has remobilised, so it's dealing with normal cases, as it were. And if there is a significant increase in cases, then that will add pressure. Now what we are seeing…
Fiona Bruce[00:07:57] So what's your plan B for that then?
Kate Forbes[00:07:58] Well, what we're seeing in Scotland is over the last four weeks that case numbers have fallen. So although they are plateauing…
Brian Cox[00:08:04]They was very high before that.
Fiona Bruce[00:08:05] They are plateauing?
Kate Forbes[00:08:06] Indeed, and they are falling just now. We want to continue that trajectory, and the way we do that is…
Fiona Bruce[00:08:11] But just to be clear, the plateauing infections have flattened?
Kate Forbes[00:08:14] But they are falling. Right now, we want to see them continue to fall, we want to see case numbers in Scotland continue to fall.
Fiona Bruce 
[00:08:20] They have fallen. I'm really sorry, they have fallen but now they're plateauing?
Kate Forbes[00:08:23] They're plateauing, that's what I said.
Fiona Bruce[00:08:24] Yes, just so we're clear.
Kate Forbes[00:08:25] Yes.
