[0:35:10] It's too soon to be doing this. We need to make sure we have things in place like electronic passes so that it's much quicker to get through the airports. We are still having queues, and mixing at airport it's only just recently they have managed to get one terminal where people come back from red lists until people were still mixing and it's too dangerous to be giving the signals this Government is doing.

[0:35:36] Thank you good evening panel. Do the Government take rape and domestic violence seriously considering the shocking exchange in Parliament, and questions about a fall in prosecution as jabber?

Fiona Bruce
[0:35:46] What you are referring to is Prime Minister's questions yesterday where the leader of the opposition Keir Starmer was asking persistently about the drop in rape convictions, it's at a 40 year low, and he is asking a lot of questions about the Government's policies, and Boris Johnson replied, one of his replies was we are getting on with the job, they, Labour, jabber, we jab. Now, that sounds like you took offence at that?

AudienceMember 20210722QT22
[0:36:16] Yes because, it wasn't about vaccinations. It was a quite serious question, and up until then, you know the Prime Minister had a really good kind of you know, what he said made sense. At that point, I was like hold on a second, again, we are being mocked in Parliament.
