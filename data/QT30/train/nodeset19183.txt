Female Aud 3[0:45:53]Eight months. Yeah. So I’d just like to come back to that point. So me and my husband have been in shielding since obviously 23 March. 
Just to give you a brief idea, my husband part way through this went onto kidney dialysis. So my question really is, the shielding group, the 2.2 million people at the end of March that got these letters who were petrified to go out of their homes, we couldn’t even go into our gardens, now the cases are going absolutely through the roof, where is the common sense…? 
And I know obviously there is treatments, but can I just highlight, there’s thousands of people waiting for organ donations across this country, and, as I spoke to Fiona earlier, the plight of my husband and many others in the same situation, he’s been put on a list to be taken off the list to be put back on the list. 
Now, my fear is that we’re going to get back to routine operations, transplantation getting stopped. It’s already happening in Leeds, it’s already happening in Nottingham, and you talk about the tier system. 
Now, I live in West Lindsey which at the minute is relatively low in tier one, however literally to the two miles at the side of me is Nottinghamshire who’ve gone into tier three from Friday, and also bordering is South Yorkshire, and from I think Saturday we’ve now got North Lincolnshire and East Hull.So with all due respect, it’s a matter of time before… 
So surely we should jump on this bandwagon now before it gets any worse.
