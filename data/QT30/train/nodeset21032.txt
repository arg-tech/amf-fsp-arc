Douglas Ross[00:40:55] And then we have said, only at the end of the parliament, if we can, you know, rebuild our education system by recruiting 3,000 additional teachers at a cost of £550 million over the course of the parliament, we would look to get parity back in the tax system, if it is possible. Because 1.1 million Scots currently pay more tax right now for doing the exact same job than elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
Anas Sarwar[00:41:22] Well, that's more income or those at the top.
Douglas Ross[00:41:21] One point one million.
Lorna Slater[00:41:22] Tax cuts for the rich.
Fiona Bruce[00:41:24] Okay. I just want to hear a little bit more from our audience – Shelly?
Shelly Unknown[00:41:26] Hello. Douglas Ross, I'm struck by the various areas that you say for investment, but I don't hear you talking about people, I'm not hearing you talk about communities. The people who've been the most hit, I would say, are the disadvantaged. We're expecting a huge homelessness spike and a peak – how would you, kind of, see that the investment where you're going to place it is going to respond to any of these issues?
