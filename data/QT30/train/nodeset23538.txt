Fiona Bruce[00:08:27] So you've got masks, you've got vaccination passports, but they're still not dropping. So what do you think you can do as Scottish Government to drive them down?
Kate Forbes[00:08:33] I think there are a few things that we can continue to do. I mean, over 30 people died today from COVID. That's 30 families who are grieving the loss of a loved one. That is 30 people who we want to ensure can get the recognition they deserve and the hope that we can reemphasise the need for all of us to follow basic precautions. And the basic restrictions that are in place just now are all designed to keep us safe, and it's the least we can do, for the sake of the NHS, the sake of our nurses, and, ultimately, to protect lives.
Fiona Bruce[00:09:09] Anas.
Anas Sarwar[00:09:09] Look, I think it's important to recognise that across the UK cases are too high. I think it's also important to recognise that Scotland had a spike three or four weeks earlier and that's partly related to the fact that our schools went back three weeks earlier than the English schools. So I think we've got to look at the pattern alongside that. But there have been fundamental errors made by a UK government, but also fundamental errors made by a Scottish Government.
