David Ross [00:31:44] The replacement is similar if you look at the level of support that individuals and employers have to put in in France, in Spain, in Germany is very similar to -- two-thirds the government are paying in the United Kingdom compared to other countries. But Ian is right, because young people are effectively the ones that could be affected by this. First of all their education. Many of them didn’t get to finish their school education, they didn’t get to sit exams, they went on to college and university, and in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom they had a terrible initial experience at university, and now they are going to be paying for this for much of their lives and the job market, when we get through this health pandemic, the global response to the economic emergency that we’re all going to face is one that we have to treat extremely seriously. So I think it is young people we have to be thinking about. That’s why the UK government have introduced schemes to help young people into employment. But, again, as the chancellor has said and the prime minister has said, it is going to be impossible to save every single job but we are putting in place tools to protect as many as possible, as we have done with the furlough scheme and the replacement scheme going forward.
