ROSIE JONES [00:51:40] I’m sat here increasingly getting annoyed because I think we’re hearing great points and you’re just taking the easy questions and giving one answer and then moving on. I wanted to come here today and talk about the vaccine and feel reassured that we’re going to go into 2021 and be in a much better and safer place, and I don’t know if we will be. MATT HANCOCK [00:52:40] I absolutely think there’s a point, which is that this vaccine that we heard about on Monday, it is good news, but we’re not there yet. And there are still a lot of steps that we need to get through. So I’m only going to reassure you and anybody else as much as I can be confident about. ROSIE JONES [00:53:00] You’re not reassuring me at all. [DONE]MATT HANCOCK [00:53:04] Well, I’m being honest about the uncertainties that we still face. I think that’s what I’m duty-bound to do. There are some things I am more confident about. Like, for instance, we’ve done the work to make sure we have the -70 capacity.
