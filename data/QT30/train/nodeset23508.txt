It's a thing.Fiona Bruce[0:53:32] It is not getting any better, saying it twice.AudienceMember 20211111QT21[0:53:34] He drives around and I have had a late night call saying "Can I come to your house and charge my car on the plug because I may not be able to get back home". The charging units are out of order. There might be somebody in the unit charging their car, having a coffee, and he is waiting. So I don't think in this area there is enough chargers. I would love an electric car, but I don't want to suffer right now with juice anxiety.Fiona Bruce[0:54:00] Tim.Tim Stanley[0:54:04] Especially if you had to take someone to hospital or in an emergency go a long distance. This comes back to my point about the gap between ambitions and where we are, the affordability. If we all tomorrow ran out and bought an electric car, which we couldn't afford to do, how would we charge them? We'd run it off the grid. If we all switched from petrol to electrification, where is that going to come from? So the infrastructure also has to catch up in order to match our ambitions.
