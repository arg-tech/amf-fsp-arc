Michelle Dewberry[00:04:26] I have not been elected once, but I tell you what, if it wasn't for people like me, the Brexit Party at the last election, there would have been way fewer Labour MPs than there are now. And this is one of the problems. In 40 years Labour have won, I think, three elections. And if you continue as you are now, in my view, you will be unelectable for a very long time to come.
Lisa Nandy[00:04:50] But what do you actually want us to do? Because I've heard lots of talk about deconstruction, but very little, particularly from the Brexit Party, about how you solve some of the problems for people in this country.
Michelle Dewberry[00:04:59] Well, first things first.
Lisa Nandy[00:05:00] People need good jobs in this country, they don't need more division, which is all the party that you stood for was offering.
