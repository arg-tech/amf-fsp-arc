Fiona Bruce[00:31:54] But one per cent wouldn't be enough, by your definition?
Andrew RT Davies[00:31:56] I don't believe it would be enough, no, and that's why I've been making a stronger recommendation to the pay review body, but I wouldn't be going arbitrarily around with numbers that I know weren't sustainable over the period and, as I said, when I was on a programme with Adam Price recently, he was talking about a 12 per cent pay rise, he's now gone to four per cent.
Adam Price[00:32:11] No, I said we should at least match the Scottish Government, I know what I said, it was only a few moments ago, we should at least match what the Scottish Government have done. Yes, the RCN is quite strongly making a compelling case for the 12.5 per cent increase because we've had that level of cut in real terms over the last ten years, but at least do what the Scottish Government has done and yes, let's aim to do more because absolutely we rely on these people and we've clapped them and what we've seen from the Conservative government is they are refusing to actually turn that into real support.
