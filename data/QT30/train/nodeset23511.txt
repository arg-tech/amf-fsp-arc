[0:23:50] So for individual companies to pay for very specific tasks to be done is something that I think might have been accepted in the public eye a few years ago but should be looked at now in the world that we live in currently. My advice to companies would be, who actually pay that money, you're as much part of this problem that we're discussing as the people here that are being talked about. A trust items on foot, leaves on horseback. I think in this case the horses were out, and that's regrettable. It would be good to provide laws that were broader to cover this.

[0:24:36] I would like to decide when the government decided this process needed review. Was it because of Mr Paterson or is it because the process needs review? Either way, as the gentlemen just said, once you committed something under one set of rules, you shouldn't suddenly change them. Change the rules, by all means, but do that because you need to change them, not because one of your mates has got a problem. [ DONE]

[0:25:04] There has been a slow burn on this. You can see a pattern of behaviour in relation to this government, particularly in relation to the Prime Minister. He won't answer questions straightforwardly about how his flat at No. 10 was redecorated, who paid for his holiday in Mustique. There were his junior ministers. We heard about the Home Secretary. Where there are breaches on the face of it on the rules, nothing seems to happen.
