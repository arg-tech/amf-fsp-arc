Fiona Bruce [00:09:08] Rachel, you’re on the frontline in terms of dealing with patients. Of course we all desperately want this desperately we going as quick as we can? Rachel Clarke [00:09:24] It’s a very pertinent question. Not only a month after we started rolling out the Pfizer vaccine are three-quarters of the over 80s unvaccinated, and I appreciate there are logistical issues, but it is also the case of tens of thousands of NHS frontline and care staff are also, still, a month after vaccine roll-out began, unvaccinated. I’m sitting here tonight as someone who is completely unvaccinated. I am on COVID wards every day, working with COVID patients, I’m very frightened that I may bring the virus home. Who knows, I may kill my husband. There are paramedics, nurses, healthcare assistants, doctors, NHS and care workers in their thousands who every day are going into an environment in which the air is thick with COVID and we are completely unvaccinated. From our point of view it feels like, in the first wave in March and April, we were sent in with woefully inadequate PPE, again it may be an excuse, it may be a reality, but the government’s position on that was logistics, it’s not our fault, it’s a supply issue. Here we are again, second time round, completely exposed to a virus that has already killed over 650 frontline NHS and care staff. So this couldn’t be more pertinent.[DONE]
