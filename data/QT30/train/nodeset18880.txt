Fiona Bruce[00:41:54] So, specifically, what action do you think should be taken?Munira Wilson[00:41:58] Well, there’s a whole…there’s already been a whole host of reviews where the recommendations have yet to be implemented. And in terms of the Home Office, ending the hostile environment would be a good place to start, for instance. There’s also things like suspicion-less stop and search – we know that black individuals are 47 times more likely to be stopped and searched.And I received last week a letter about a 15-year-old mixed race boy in my constituency, a law-abiding young man, I heard from his head teacher, and he has been stopped countless times by the police, they’re convinced it’s racial profiling. Even when he’s been out with his white friends, the police have stopped him to question him but not his white friends. His parents are terrified that at some point he’s going to get into more trouble because he’s going to react to being stopped. This shouldn’t be happening.And clearly, there are systemic issues that need to be tackled, and that’s where, you know, David Lammy’s review, we’re still waiting for some of those recommendations to be implemented. So yes, another review is important, but it shouldn’t just be a research project, it should be setting goals and targets and measures for us to be tracking progress against.
