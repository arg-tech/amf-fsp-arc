Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:13:51] Well, the challenge was put to me about captain hindsight, but I called back in January for a comprehensive hotel quarantine. I put it to a vote of parliament on 1 February. The Tory MPs failed to support it. I called out the issue of the failure to put India onto the red list for 14 days after Pakistan and Bangladesh had already been added. But I do say to Nadhim today, we can of course debate across this studio about this, but I say it because you need to get this right. The biggest threat to getting our freedoms back is a variant coming from overseas threatening the efficacy of the vaccine rollout that I know you're working on. That's why you have to get this right and rethink this traffic light system.Fiona Bruce[00:14:37] We've got a question on this. Collette, would you like to put your question?
