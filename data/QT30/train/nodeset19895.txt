Anand Menon [00:38:50] There are contradictory numbers out there. What I would say is the imperial College study is scary in that it doesn’t tell us whether or not the cases are going down from December. There is other evidence that suggests from December cases are going down. So there is a tiny bit of light. I think we should also say to date the vaccine programme has been remarkably successful. A combination, if lockdown is having that impact with vaccine being rolled out effectively, you can see a way in which lockdown could work. But we’re going to have to stick with it for a long time. I do think after this, now is not the time to do it, we are going to have to have a public inquiry. We have to think about how we organise ourselves as a society. We run our leaflets hotly every winter. One of the lessons of this pandemic is we might need to think more about resilience, less about efficiency, so we have capacity to spare should we end up in this situation again.
