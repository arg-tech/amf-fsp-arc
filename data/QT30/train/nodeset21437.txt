[PETER KYLE] : That's 7 months' time. Students will be leaving school. 

[LUCY FRAZER] : Can I just make one other point. It is really important. Because I, like you, think education is absolutely fundamentally important. It's one of the reasons I went into politics. I think it is really important we invest in young people. One of the first announcements that Boris Johnson made when he became leader of the country was to announce 14 billion pounds into education for the following three years. To level up every single primary and secondary school pupil so that we had a good baseline. That's a baseline, from which we are working. On top of that, we've just announced the 3 billion and the prime minister has said, very clearly, the door is not shut but we need to review the evidence. And the spending review will be coming up in the autumn and we will look at it then.
