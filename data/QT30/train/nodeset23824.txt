AudienceMember 20210902QT29[0:36:08] We saw this morning Nick Carter making the rounds of the breakfast television.Fiona Bruce[0:36:14] Brigadier Nick Carter.AudienceMember 20210902QT30[0:36:18] (24) Quibbling whether the Taliban were the enemy, or even were the enemy. He is someone who has been in the top of the military hierarchy for many years. He bears responsibility for many of the failures. We as a nation need to accept that we have been defeated, and the generals responsible for that need to be held to account. James, will you assure me that people like Nick Carter will not be allowed to retire and go and work off the board of a private military contractor and live very well-remunerated lives, will at least have a moment where they are held in very, very humble silence for the decisions that they've made, and that is the only way as a veteran that I and my fellow veterans will feel at the very least we've learned something, so in 20 years' time, the next generation is not in some other country undergoing the same process? [Applause].Fiona Bruce[0:37:18] I should say, of course, that Nick Carter is not here to defend himself, to put his view, but James, you've been asked the question directly.James Cleverly[0:37:26] Well, first of all, thank you. I have been in the military for a long while - the reserve forces - I've never served in Afghanistan. Obviously, I know lots of people that have. I know people who have had life-changing injuries, and obviously, we, just as all the countries that contributed troops to Afghanistan, we've lost some of our brightest and best people, and that is obviously a huge sadness, and something of huge regret.
