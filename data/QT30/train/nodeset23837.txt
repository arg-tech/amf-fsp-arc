AudienceMember 20210902QT37[0:53:36] (30) War is terror. It is the most nonsensical thing I've heard in my life. War is terror. Here we are 20 years on in this particular conflict. We could be talking about Iraq tonight, Libya, or Syria. The reality is as much as there may be terrorists out there, actually, the people who blew up the tube in 7/7 in 2005, they were from Leeds where I live. The person who blew himself up in Manchester was from London. They are in this country right now. The reality is that there is no one place on this earth where there is terrorism going on. It goes on all around the world. You cannot defeat an ideology from dropping bombs from 30,000 feet. [Applause].
