Fiona Bruce[0:49:10] Would a Labour defeat be the final nail in the coffin for the party?Chika Russell[0:49:16] I think so. Because more and more of them are voting conservative. Better the devil you know than the angel you don't. With the party they have now, they've had the benefit of the furlough, the benefit of getting support during this pandemic and they accessed it quite easily. To go back to a government with, you know, where they haven't felt listened to I think is going to be difficult. If they do lose this election this time, then it really will be very difficult for them to go back and therefore, in that area, it could be the end for them. More and more people are voting Conservative.David Davis[0:50:04] If we win, which I think is quite likely, but we'll know in a few hours, is it the end of Labour? No, it's not. I've seen both parties be on their uppers in the time I've been an adult and come back with it. Whether in York or us with 100 seats in Parliament to where they are now. Should they get rid of Starmer? Well, it won't solve their civil war, which is the current problem. Where they can't decide where they are. Neither will it solve the problem they have now.
