[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : As we heard from the audience, this is failing children. But I'll tell you who else it is failing, in five years' time it will be failing business because people will not be skilled for the jobs that will be needed in the post-COVID economy. And, Tim, I loved you calling out Marcus Rashford. What we need is more people that make a difference. 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Heather, what do you think of those who say it would be lovely to spend 15 billion on education but there are going to be so many demands on the public purse? This is one among many and ultimately is all going to have to be paid back one day.
