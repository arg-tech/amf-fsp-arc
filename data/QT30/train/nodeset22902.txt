ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:24:44] We need to realise there has been enormous excitement about this vaccine because it is the first evidence that it is a vaccine vaccine-preventible disease. But that doesn’t mean it is going to be the only vaccine. I think what is encouraging, if we also believe the news coming out of Russia, we’ll see a series of vaccines coming through which may have different advantages for distribution. Right now we have to work as if this is the only vaccine that’s going to work but we could have a different conversation in four weeks’ time. I think it comes to this issue of prioritisation. It is a difficult vaccine to get out. There’s about 10 million vulnerable population. If you start vaccinating in January, given that it takes 5 to 6 weeks to get immunity, and you did a million people a week, we wouldn’t get that 10 million vaccinated until way into April, and that’s assuming everybody comes in for their first shot and for their second shot and you are not playing catch-up. So the logistical problem is immense. That doesn’t mean that people should be off the hook, but it is to understand that that challenge is why we need to prioritise the way the vaccine is rolled out.
