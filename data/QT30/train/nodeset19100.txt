Fiona Bruce [00:51:04] What about the point that, with Brexit looming, what that may bring, being in the middle of a pandemic, this is something that should be put on the back burner for now. Kate Forbes [00:51:14] Thatâ€™s why right now from the Scottish government perspective of my day is spent in dealing with the virus and dealing with the economic fall-out of the virus. But there are going to be questions emerging. If you take one question like economic recovery, the last time we saw the UK government borrowing to these levels was probably 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crash. That was followed by a decade of austerity, where the poorest in society paid for the failures. As we come out of this crisis, I want to ensure that we are investing in people, we are investing in infrastructure and we deal with our public finances in a fundamentally different way. That will require financial powers, fiscal powers to be in the hands of Scottish government not the Conservatives in Westminster that most people in Scotland can vote for.
