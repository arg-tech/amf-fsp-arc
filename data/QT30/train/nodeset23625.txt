It has gone on and on and it needs resolving. Briefly on the Sarah Everard point, we are all in the media, most of what we say...Fiona Bruce[0:54:08] Well, you are a farmer.Minette Batters[0:54:10] I'm standing up for my farmers at the moment and I'm in the media a lot and most of what we say is forgotten the next day or maybe an hour later even. When I listened to Sarah Everard's mother give that statement, I will remember that, I think, to my dying day because we've all got daughters, nieces, friends. We've got people who could have got in that car and would have done. I guess the question I am asking and what that family must be feeling is from March 3rd, why did it take from March 3rd to October to call for that inquiry? Because that's what I would want to know if I was her mother.
