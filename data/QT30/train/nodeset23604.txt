Nick, the question allowing the mass slaughter of pigs that won't go into the food chain, what's happening with our food production?

 Let's just pause for a second. It is actually not the fault of government that more young people seem to be attracted to vegetarianism and don't want to handle meat. Let's be fair. The Government doesn't control the condition in our abattoirs and demand be a butcher. Let's park that there. What you can control, Nadhim, is how people can get into this country. It is a very good point by the gentleman up the back that the whole idea was that we were going to have workers here and that needs to be addressed and if, as you promise, 1 day, workers in this country will have higher wages, good, but we find ourselves in a situation, almost I believe of a mirror of what we saw with the truck drivers, okay. And that became very difficult and we still have that affecting us and the drivers of the petrol tankers. The whole idea of Brexit was that we could control who we want to come in. I would urge you to go from here to talk to your colleagues in the employment department, whatever else it might be, let's switch on that tap now don't let's have the situation we had the hauliers.
