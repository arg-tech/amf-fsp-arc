That's the thing I would take away. With the greatest respect to the lady who -- and I understand her point -- who was saying we all need to be responsible, it is not the responsibility of women to stop being murdered, it is the responsibility of men to stop murdering women. One other thing I would like to say and I think -- we can already see this with the nature of this conversation. I think we'll be talking about this for a long time moving forward, and that's right, but, you know, however we feel -- we all feel and the horror we feel and the pain we feel and the shock we feel at what's happening, I think we all have to remember as we move forward that it is nothing compared to what Sara Everard's family are feeling this morning. I don't want to be in any way crass about this, but we're talking about this in a clinical, policy-driven way about an appalling human event.
