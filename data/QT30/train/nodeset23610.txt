Fiona Bruce[0:28:06] Yes?

AudienceMember 20211014QT20[0:28:10] I find this is a ridiculous and sad situation. We have food poverty in this country. We are throwing away decent food that could feed children who are going hungry. They've got to do something. It is just ridiculous. 

Fiona Bruce [0:28:28] Nadhim, what's it come to this that pigs are being culled?
Nadhim Zahawi[0:28:38] George Eustice is working with the abattoirs. Butchers are on the visa list. One thing is the English language requirement that we're looking at as well. A good deal of good work is taking place and the same, of course, with seasonal workers. We've increased that by 5,000 to 30,000. I represent the rural constituency of Stratford upon Avon and I've got Vale fresco that produces the salad for supermarkets and Wheelmore. I went to see both just to see what is happening and just to give you, bring it to life for you, Wheelmore said, "look, it is tough, but we're coping and we're doing well. We're going to invest because Rishi Sunak is giving a tax break, you get 25% of that back. We're going to invest in more machinery and invest in upskilling our people so they can work with that machinery."

Fiona Bruce[0:29:42] But that's not going to help culling pigs, is it?

Nadhim Zahawi[0:29:46] I thought I dealt with the issue around the visas on the abattoirs, but the temporary visas is not enough, we have got to go further and work with the industry on sustainable solutions to this.
