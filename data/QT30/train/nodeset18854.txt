Munira Wilson[00:08:41] Yes, we’ve been calling for this for many weeks, and in fact in Wales we have a Liberal Democrat Education Secretary and she had committed to funding school meals through the summer some time ago. So, this is something we’ve been pushing for, and indeed so had the Labour Party and, you know, a number of other opposition parties. So we’re hugely grateful to Marcus Rashford, of whom I’m a huge fan and I wish we were watching him in the Euro 2020 at the moment, but we find ourselves in these circumstances. And, as I say, I’m grateful that he’s forced the government to make this change, and so will many many millions of children across the country be.
Fiona Bruce[00:09:21] Is it a bit tricky, James, that for the days running up to the government’s change of heart on this, you had cabinet minister after cabinet minister saying, no, no, we’re absolutely not going to change our mind about this, we’re funding money through local councils, we’re absolutely not going to change our mind, and then Marcus Rashford pops up and that’s the thing that makes the difference?
