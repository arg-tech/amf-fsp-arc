Fiona Bruce[0:32:12] Danny I'm interested in your perspective as head of Oxfam GB, and can you see, there would be some who would not take Daisy's view, and think I want to get myself vaccinated first before I start sending vaccines abroad.
Danny Sriskandarajah[0:32:24] First we need to recognise how devastating what is going on in India. This is not a wave, this is a tsunami, and many experts said it was a question of when not "if" we would see these impacts. We have seen it in Brazil, and South Africa and now in India. There's a debate about excess stock. We believe the real answer lies in not fighting about the pieces of the vaccine pie, but making the pie bigger! What we are calling on the UK Government to do is to ease the intellectual property rules around who owns this vaccine technology, who owns the vaccine recipes, you know...
Fiona Bruce[0:33:02] Rather than do what Daisy is suggesting after the first four million start sending vaccines abroad?
Danny Sriskandarajah[0:33:10] Do both. But the substantial difference is going to be made when we allow other manufacturers, countries, to safely manufacturer these vaccines, the US Government has said it's considering this seriously but, in the world trade organisation negotiation so far, our Government has blocked those sorts of moves. Yet we are talking about for example, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is 97% funded by us, the public, the taxpayers.
