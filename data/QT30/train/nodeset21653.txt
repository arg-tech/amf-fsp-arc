[0:21:04] We always had to live with viruses ever since we started getting the liquids and saliva and the blood of animals on us. If we are to keep doing that, we have to face that. I'd rather not. I'd rather the world go vegan.

[0:21:26] David, you have been critical of the restrictions. The Prime Minister indicated some of those may continue, who knows how long for. What do you think the summer, autumn going into winter is going to look at.

David Davis
[0:21:44] It depends what happens with the decease.

Fiona Bruce
[0:21:46] That's an unknown. Given what we know at present.

David Davis
[0:21:50] It is not entirely an unknown. We can see the trajectory now. People talk about breaking the link between the cases and the hospitalisation and the hospitals. It is not a broken link, it is a dramatically suppressed link. That's working because the vaccines, the therapies are working as well. The aim is to get this to a point where -- it's never going to be non-fatal but less than flu, if you like. Flu kills between 5 and 25,000 people a year and we don't lock down because of flu. So, that's the first thing. Now, assuming we can get there, I want to see us go back as close to the freedoms we had before as we possibly can.
