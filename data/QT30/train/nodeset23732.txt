They can ask for a lot more than they could before. Average wages have skyrocketed. The shortages, the flipside of it, there are lots of problems with it, but the flipside of it is that wages are going up, workers who got us through the pandemic, the people who couldn't stay home, who were in the shops, who were delivering the packages, who were driving on the road, they are about to be valued. 

They are about to be valued so much more than they were the decade before when they were struggling for stagnant wages, and I am really torn on this one, because as somebody who was very supportive of Brexit and thinks has a lot of opportunity, I was also devastated to see free movement go. I've always been a big advocate of free movement, but if there is a benefit to what has happened is that native workers are about to get that big pay raise, and they so, so deserve it, and I think Grant's right that even if you added lorry drivers to the skilled working list, the shortage is across Europe now. It is not at all obvious that we solve the problem overnight. Workers are now empowered to ask for more money. They should do, they should ask for better working conditions. This is their moment, in terms of winners and losers, and there are always are, is the workers who got us through the pandemic that are about, I think, to have some real winnings come their way, and I'm excited to see it.
