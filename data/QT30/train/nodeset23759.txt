Grant Shapps[0:57:25] Yeah, but the point I make is that we should be able to use the fact that they have been able to open up online services and there will be some people who are happy to do that, because it's convenient for their lives, to be able to see more people over any given day, and the fact that not enough GP services are opening up isn't acceptable, we absolutely think everybody has a right to see a GP face to face.
