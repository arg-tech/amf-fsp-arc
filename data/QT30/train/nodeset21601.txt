Sarah Jones[0:50:46] We haven't seen the detail yet. On issues like this I look to organisations like the National Farmers Union. They are concerned in a similar way that Ian and Rosemary have outlined. Very concerned about animal welfare standards the NFU have talked about. I remember being on Question Time a couple of years ago talking about why we can't put some of this stuff into legislation to make sure this doesn't occur. I know farmers are concerned that we'll see products coming into this country and undermining our farmers. It is very -- separating it from the economy it is very interesting to look at how we as a country take on this kind of new role in global Britain now we are outside the EU how we use our soft power, our skills, our negotiating skills, our capacity to trade with other countries --

Fiona Bruce[0:51:36] The question is does this set a terrible precedent?

Sarah Jones[0:51:42] It is a poor deal. It is a very small amount of GDP, 0.02%. But for those farmers which are going to be undercut, which the government said would never happen, is now happening.
