[00:19:15] Much of politics now is about identity, culture and values. And I think that the people who have understood that quickest have been the Conservatives. And actually the people who have understood it most successfully have been Kate's Scottish National Party. Because the Scottish cosmopolitan national identity is real, they represent it. Mark Drakeford in Wales represents a feeling about being Welsh, more than just Labour. So those profoundly working-class communities in Wales, solidly Labour, Andy Burnham…see, Andy Burnham didn't just win central Manchester, he won seats, including where I come from, where they voted Tory, because he projected something, a narrative, a real…somebody that allowed him to stand beyond the different identities. And believe me, we know, north-western little towns have identities that we almost hate each other. 

Now, what Keir hasn't done yet is that. Simple as that. He needs policies, a narrative, a goal, a clear story to tell. I supported him and continue to support him because I think he's a person who can do that, but it's not as easy as when Labour used to be able to weigh these votes in these places, those votes have to be earned. That means understanding what has caused these deep cultural divisions and certainly you can't go with them.
