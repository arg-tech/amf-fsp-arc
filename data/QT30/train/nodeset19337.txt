Fiona Bruce [00:45:38] Peter, you wanted to come in. 
Peter Openshaw [00:45:42] I think it is desperately important that there is attention paid to scientific collaboration in the negotiations over Brexit. We know the collaborations we’ve had over the past few decades within the EU have been absolutely vital in driving big science. That’s the way science is going, it is very collaborative, very international, and we benefited hugely from the European funding system where every 5 million we put in we get 8.6 million back. So this is a very, very important point for UK universities, for UK science, that we get a really good deal in terms of being able still to continue all that collaboration.
