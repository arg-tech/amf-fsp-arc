Michelle Donelan [00:44:48] Would you have preferred the negotiators to have given in earlier and not stood by Britain’s interest. Sarah Jones [00:44:56] I would have preferred the prime minister to be correct when he said I will get the deal in July, which is what he promised in June, he said he would have the deal in July. He didn’t. He was confident the deal was oven-ready in December. We haven’t seen it. If you’re in manufacturing now, how can you encourage investment from abroad if you don’t know if you’re going to be under a tariff regime in a few weeks time. If you’re a farmer, how can you plan for the future if you don’t know what the tariff regime is going to be. Our financial services are already making the decision to go elsewhere because all this uncertainty means people have no idea what’s ahead. That’s bad management from government. [DONE]Michelle Donelan [00:45:36] It’s an active negotiation.
