Paul Scully[1:04:40] I'm glad action is being taken. One of the people is not going to be selected. But we need to do more.
Fiona Bruce[1:04:52] Paul Polman, you don't live here, but I'm thinking in terms of your role as head of Unilever, a massive multi-national company, this must be an issue you have also dealt with.
Paul Polman[1:05:06] You don't need to live in the UK or anywhere, this is a global issue. My daughter-in-law who lives in the UK is from Singapore and she has to deal with this every week. She is a lawyer in London and it is totally intolerable. She deals with it but there is an underlying issue that goes much deeper that I think is in every culture coming up where hate is being spread, where social media doesn't work in our favour, and we have to fight that. If we stay silent, we become complicit.
