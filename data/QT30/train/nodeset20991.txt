Fiona Bruce[00:14:30] I mean, clearly there are other NHS statistics that you could cite that aren't quite so favourable, but I hear what you say, Angela. Willie?
Willie Rennie[00:14:35] So, Fiona, let's take the issue of drugs. Scotland's got a terrible record on drug deaths â€“ 1,256 people died, it's the worst in Europe, in fact it's the worst in the developed world, it's three and a half times what it is in England. And the confession from the First Minister was that through the independence debate she took her eye off the ball. And we know from the previous Justice Secretary that they didn't want to deal with the issue because it was too difficult and it might repeal people from voting for independence at the time. Now, that's what we could have multiplied in the next five years. If the SNP, and the Greens, allow us to have a parliament that's focused on independence, many many other things will be neglected. More people will die. This is real people's lives. We need to focus on dealing with the massive challenges we've got.
