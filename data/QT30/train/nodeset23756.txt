Kate Andrews[0:55:40] Now, I don't pretend for a moment that that's easy, but GPs are earning somewhere between two to three times what your average earner in the UK is. They need to be back in the office and they need to see patients who want to be face to face, for those who already know that they're sick and can't get treatment, for those who don't know that they're sick yet, and for those who are just anxious and nervous about what might be down the road, we're talking in some cases about life or death. Surely after the year of COVID, year and a half of COVID, we now really understand what life and death means, and that shouldn't just apply to the virus, it should apply to every major illness, and those patients deserve the time and the treatment as well.
Fiona Bruce[0:56:29] Yes.
