Fiona Bruce[0:15:42] You wouldn't have sacked him, that's the point.Andy Burnham[0:15:48] It is not a political point, I think we are at quite a potentially risky moment in the pandemic. I pick up something Madeline said. There's a growing sense of inconsistency here in terms of how rules are being applied. I'll give you an example. You have parents complaining they can't go to school sports days and see Wimbledon packed out. In our case you have the Scottish government, not all the UK government, out of nowhere hitting Manchester and Salford at the same time as thousands and thousands of people were leaving Scotland to go to London for the football. The danger is governments are behaving inconsistently now. If they carry on that way, people are going to say we're not putting up with this.David Davis[0:16:36] I think they already are.Fiona Bruce[0:16:38] Some might be, but a lot of our audience are obeying the rules.David Davis[0:16:44] If you walked up a street in London after the match, there were lots of pubs full of people breaking all the rules you're talking about. That's already happening, I'm afraid. And you're right, part of it is because of the complexity and inconsistency of the rules. We agree on that. Part of it is because the leaders are not showing the way.
