Fiona Bruce[0:35:02] In terms of what Danny is saying there's a loosening of property rights, what would you say?
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:35:06] That's across the world. So interestingly with Oxford AstraZeneca, they made a commitment upfront that 300 million doses would feed Kofax, and we have now invested 548 million into Covak and it's been match-funded by other donors so it has a billion pounds to work with. Part of its purpose is to be able to buy vaccines at cost and ensure that there can be that shared production both for developed countries who are buying it, and also Kofax can be buying for developing countries.
Fiona Bruce[0:35:40] The UK is opposing waving UK intellectual property rights is there any cha changing your minds?
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:35:46] The discussions are ongoing with the WTO and I'm not party to the detail. But the important thing is getting those vaccines made! Interestingly last year
Fiona Bruce[0:35:58] That's the question he has asked you and I appreciate the other things are being done.
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:36:04] I'm not in the WTO conversations
Fiona Bruce[0:36:06] But you are here for the Government tonight what is your view?
Anne-Marie Trevelyan[0:36:08] We knew this would be a challenge is the ability to produce the vaccine in the quantities that are needed because, you know India's population over a billion and so on, there's a need for the quantum, and interestingly, Bill Gates made a move last summer said I'm going to create vaccine production facilities, I don't know if there's a vaccine that we could use and there could be a vaccine. And India has been the heart of other vaccines for many countries for lots of years.
