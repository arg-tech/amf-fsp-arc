[ANTHONY COSTELLO] : Children feel abandoned. They have lost their education. I think the figure is 110 days out of 190 they've had social isolation, mental health problems, they've lost their exams. Many people have lost their University experience and their vocational training. This is a disaster. James Heckman, the American economist, won his Nobel prize because he showed how each dollar or pound of investment gets a fantastic return the earlier you start, from pregnancy, early childhood development, primary schooling, secondary schooling. We spend most per head, interestingly, in this country on tertiary education rather than all the others and vocational. But that's a good thing as well. Children are our future and we need children not just to be invested in through the education system but in all policies. Because they're facing not only this pandemic, which is a kind of tea party compared to the disaster of climate change that we're going to face, and they need to have investment in all kinds of things: Play areas, transport, food systems, agriculture, environment, to reshape their lives for the future and give them an optimism to believe that they can really cope with what's going to be thrown at us from an unstable climate as well.
