Fiona Bruce [00:13:50] Are you concerned after 31 December we might have a problem getting the vaccines as speedily as we like? 

Michelle Donelan [00:13:56] The negotiations are going on, we know that. They are going to the wire, we all appreciate that. They are still going on. We have done endless preparations for every eventuality. 705 million into our borders. We are prepared, should that happen, either way. 

Fiona Bruce [00:14:12] Peter, have you any concerns about that, in terms of medicines coming across, but vaccines in particular after 31 December, is that something you discussed as scientists? [DONE]
Peter Openshaw [00:14:22] I desperately hope not. It would be an absolute disaster if it were to cause problems with transport of medicine -- other medicine as well as vaccines. I think it highlights an issue we have all been concerned about in the arena is that a lot of our medicine absolutely sure the supply is going to be uninterrupted. We have often quite shore supply trains, not very large stocks, of a lot of medications. I think this illustrates that problem. But I hope it will be overcome. It is a political problem rather than a scientific one.
