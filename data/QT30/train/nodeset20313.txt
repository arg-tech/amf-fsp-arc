Michael Forsyth[0:23:16] They did.
Jeane Freeman[0:23:16] You only get a choice once.
Michael Forsyth[0:23:20] That's what your party said. Once in a generation. (My video has stopped). -- that we would be in the European Union. If we voted to leave the UK union we would be out of Europe. Look what's happened. 62 percent of people in Scotland voted against Brexit and now we're out of Europe with huge bureaucracy, real damage to the economy in Scotland, and I hope we come on to that. So what we are saying is people in Scotland have the right to choose. They have the right to choose. We'll have the argument about whether or not we are independent if people choose that they want a referendum. It is really straightforward and it is a basic democratic question and no one, actually no one, should deny the democratic right of people in Scotland to choose if they want to have a referendum to be an independent country or not.

Audience Member[0:24:22] I think the point that Jeane Freeman makes is quite a good point. I think the people of Scotland have spoken on a number of occasions with regard to how they want to be managed in the UK environment.
