Fiona Bruce[0:03:24] Rosemary.Rosemary Squire[0:03:30] I have a young daughter with downs syndrome who is clinically vulnerable in general. I know it is very difficult to compel anyone to do anything but I do feel my daughter, in the situation she lives in, as part of their job, the people who support her to live should be vaccinated . I think it is part of the job and it needs to happen now, I'm afraid.Fiona Bruce[0:03:56] I guess it comes down to who is right to take priority. Is it the person like Rosemary's daughter who is not choosing to be looked after or the people who take the job.
