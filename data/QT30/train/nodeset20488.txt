Tony Danker[0:21:52] We missed the fact that automatic movement is missing, what we're all missing is the fact that if the chancellor comes forward with a few months of support, and I hope and believe he will, whether we get any demand into our businesses in the next 6 months, whether or not people are going to come back to pubs is the business reality. So let's not get too divided on this one. We have a roadmap, it is a reasonable roadmap, I think support has been generous. All I think I would ask, Grant, is the government tries a bit harder to get inside the business decision-making of firms because the truth is, before next Wednesday some firms will take a decision to pack up. I think we could have avoided that. We could have aligned the chancellor's announcement with the prime minister's. Let's stay connected on this, get inside the mind of the business person and the way they make decisions.
