[0:25:40] I think Grenfell is nearly four years ago, and I think the Government has had four years to consider the position to gather the data, to consult with industry experts, to perhaps come forward with some suggestions in a road map. Whilst I understand this does offer some relief, evidently it does not resolve the problem. It leaves many, many people in a very hopeless and desperate situation. Perhaps you could tell me your thoughts on the road map.

[0:26:10] When it be resolved for someone like Natalie, and where she's not going to have to be stumping up for these things, and she's living in unsafe accommodation?

Anne-Marie Trevelyan
[0:26:22] That's the challenge Government has. What's the answer? I can't give you the detail of the plan but

Fiona Bruce
[0:26:28] If you know this is the start you must have some idea what's coming next?

Anne-Marie Trevelyan
[0:26:32] What I see, and you know, the way you know, any great challenge is tackled is there's been the huge amount of analysis to work out how big the problem is, it is indeed much larger than perhaps was initially understood, and the challenge is with this first, with the bill, to set this in place and the fund to help and move that forwards. There's an ongoing challenge. There's obviously the work that's been done to make sure that you know, cladding is now safe, that we aren't going to be using the sort of unsafe cladding that was there.
