Fiona Bruce[1:01:10] I'm going to explain what the term is. I don't need to cause offence. It is the P word, spelled P-A-K-I. He found it hugely offensive.Tim Stanley[1:01:26] It is hugely offensive. It was always hugely offensive. Sometimes when people use the banter defence, they mean "I saw it used on a 70s sitcom". People use it all the time. I haven't caught up and I didn't know. Actually, all that sort of language was considered offensive to tell the truth because it was offensive because it is derogatory. There's no possible explanation for it. I'm not astonished the language is being used, I'm astonished such an august institution like that, critical to English sport, would behave in such a way. The answer to your question is no. Never.Emily Thornberry[1:02:14] I don't think I have a great deal more to add apart from this, which is British kids whose heritage is from the -- south Asia, are very often really, really keen on cricket. You see loads of kids of Asian heritage playing cricket. For a cricket club that is hoping to be, you know, as good as it possibly can be, to alienate huge amounts of talent like that because of racism is alienating those youngsters who should be embraced by the club, just because that's the right thing to do, but also the club is doing a grave injustice because they are not getting these talented kids. To override talent by racism is never going to help anyone.
