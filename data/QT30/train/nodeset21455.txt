[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : We have to accept that, just like people, you know, a man dies of pros Tate cancer every 45 minutes in the UK, we're not up in arms about that every second of the day. We need to accept that this is going to be with us. We need to have a balance, I think, between the economy and people's lives and, you know, what we can do with our freedoms.[D 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Pierce, you mentioned mental health. We have a question on that. Let's take that now from Ryan. 
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Thank you, Fiona. My question is, as we see Naomi Osaka withdraw from the French Open, when will issues of mental health ever be seriously considered? 
[FIONA BRUCE] : For those of you not completely across this story, the world No. 2, Naomi Osaka, she pulled out the French Open after she decided she would no longer take part in post-match press matches. She has been fined for that and threatened with sanctions as well. Jenni.
