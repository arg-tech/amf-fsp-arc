Angela Haggerty[0:47:04] The SNP as a single issue party can provide a home but because the SNP is in government in Scotland as well, it then has to come up with policies and it has to take positions on things. So you can't walk -- it is a tightrope to walk and the SNP can't continue to do that long term. It was inevitable something like this would happen but the SNP was counting on it happening after independence not before it. .

Stephen Fitzpatrick[0:47:38] What I thought I heard is because a politician is particularly popular at the moment, then it may be okay if they breach a ministerial code, they would not resign where otherwise they normally would. I didn't have much to say about this before but I can't believe what I just heard. I have to say, I think the Scottish people expect more from their politicians than the rest of the UK.
