Fiona Bruce [00:09:20] What does that mean, a circuit break? How would you define that. 
Seema Malhotra [00:09:28] It would be more along the lines of where we were in May with people staying at home but there can be variations on that because we are further forward. What has been very clear from Keir Starmer is that -- from from the Labour Party is we need to keep schools open. I think that is universally felt, we should do what we can to keep schools open. If we are to have a circuit breaker, the estimate being we could save 8,000 lines of business because we get it under control prior to Christmas and we protect the NHS in doing that. That has to be done -- we listen to. If we delay, as the government has repeatedly, then the consequences will be far greater both in terms of impact on jobs and livelihoods but also on the nationâ€™s health and the number of deaths.
