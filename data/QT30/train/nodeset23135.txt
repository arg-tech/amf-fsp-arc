Fiona Bruce[00:18:21] So do you think we should start exporting vaccines from the UK before we've vaccinate our entire population, for example? 
Nigel Owens[00:18:29] I think it's getting the balance right, as I said. I don't think we can sort of stop vaccinating within our country and then send everything abroad. We need to get the balance right and get the numbers right and hopefully abroad and the other countries as well can apply that bit of common sense to the way that they want to do it as well. So I think we need to keep vaccinating this country, but also make sure that we do all we can in encouraging and making sure other people get vaccinated in other parts of the country as well, because what you've got to remember is people have family, friends in other countries as well who will need the vaccine, so it's not a time to be selfish now. It's time for everybody to pull together and help each other and that includes us helping each other in this country, and when an opportunity is there to help other people in other countries as well.
