Fiona Bruce[0:27:16] What's your answer to the question?
Anneliese Dodds[0:27:16] I think we have to be driven by the evidence. I don't think a politician saying black and white, yes, no, on this without having that evidence is credible, to be honest with you. We need to look at this carefully. I'm sure Grant will talk about this, the government have announced a review around this subject. I think that's right. If there is, for example, a system in the future that's introduced, it needs to command public support if it is going to come in. It needs to be credible.
Fiona Bruce[0:27:42] But just to be clear, at the moment you don't have a position whether the vaccine passport to be able to get into businesses, restaurants, for example, you don't have a position whether it is a good or bad idea.
Anneliese Dodds[0:27:54] We need to have the evidence around this. We need to understand more.
