Fiona Bruce [00:34:40] Robert, looking at the situation in England, we had the Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, warning that three and a half million jobs are at risk in the hospitality sector. The government’s coming under a lot of pressure from Conservative MPs to do more for businesses like Rosina’s, and in particular reduce this two metre distance, any chance of that happening?
Robert Buckland [00:35:00] Well look, I think Rosina actually makes a really important about the confidence that people will have, and, you know, governments will have regulations and have plans and guidance, but without that confidence, then, you know, other things will happen. And I think she’s right to remind us that this isn’t going to be something that we will have an end date to, and that all will be well. We have, of course, extended things like the furlough scheme into October, and in Wales, about 418 thousand people have been supported through various government schemes, which is welcome, but this isn’t a problem for weeks or months, this is a problem that’s going to endure for a much longer period. I think within government, we’re right to have the debate, in fact the debate is happening across the country, because as you said, there are different international standards. But, I do think it’s right that we stick to the [lath 00:35:49] on two metres, we’ve got to be clear about that.
