Claire Fox[00:24:10] The other thing we have to bear in mind is AstraZeneca and the Oxford scientists who developed it specifically made sure that AstraZeneca was a cheap vaccine that could be used by all parts of the world, all over the place. I mean, if we did have any spare, by the way, I would want to give it to those countries a lot poorer than those in the European Union, as it happens. But it's also the case that that is a cheap vaccine, and the UK has actually invested huge amounts of money in helping vaccine rollout round the world. So there's this presentation that is just topsy-turvy that somehow England's greedily sitting on all these vaccines when actually Ursula von der Leyen has been irresponsible in the extreme and the European Commission in making political hay of a health situation and actually it's the people in Europe and the different European countries that I feel most sorry for, in France and in Germany, where the vaccination take-up is very low and when they didn't use those vaccines and that seems to me to be tragic but we shouldn't rewrite this story in a way that makes it seem as though this is greedy England sitting on…greedy UK sitting on…greedy Wales sitting on excess vaccines. That's just not the reality of the situation.
