It is clear for all to see there’s infrastructure at our ports to deal with the SPS checks. That was an essential part of the agreement that has been reached. Much be said about the protocol. The protocol is a protection because the reality is also that throughout all of the Brexit debate what was very clear was the fact of the about the was very much on an English agenda not in the best interests of the people who live here. We sought the protection.

I have to say that time and time again I’m no longer astonished in terms of the British government to owe who have tried to run roughshod over the Good Friday Agreement.

But I will be looking towards the EU that there is full implementation of the protocol and it is protected.[DONE]
