Fiona Bruce[00:23:25] And, Steve, there seems to be an element of some schools kind of ploughing their own furrow. Private schools have been talking over the last couple of days that they’re going to get their own kind of app going and that they are committed to getting all children back in school by September.Steve Parish[00:23:37] Well, look, I would say…I would agree with Lisa on a lot of things. We don’t seem to have a strategy to exit the lockdown in any industry. You know, we are fortunate enough in football that we have the resources and the money to develop our own strategy and we can test players twice a week, and we have a fairly limited requirement without supporters.This virus most likely will stay with us in this guise for the foreseeable future. We all hope for a vaccine, we hope for better interventions but we know they’re not likely to come. If the lockdown worked, which we all think it did, when we come out of lockdown the infections will rise. And if we can’t track those infections down and trace them and quell those outbreaks, we really are in for a terrible time economically.
