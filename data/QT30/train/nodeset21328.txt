[00:54:12] So you're going to be side hugging, are you? So what is it, how does this cautious hugging work then?
Robert Buckland 
[00:54:17] I think have your own unofficial list. Hug your mum, hug your dad, hug the people who are close to you and your family. I think hugging is fantastic, but I think we can trust everybody to use common sense, that is what the Government is saying. Use your good sense but let's get back and let's get hugging in a sensible and safe way.
Fiona Bruce 
[00:54:41] And at the risk of sounding like a total killjoy, the news about the Indian variant in the UK, is that giving the Government pause on hugging advice and general lifting of restrictions?
Robert Buckland 
[00:54:51] Well, as we said, we always said that the rise of any new variants would be a very important factor in working out how we went through the roadmap. Now, the 17th, I think, all systems go, it's absolutely right that we do that. We always said that these dates were at the earliest and therefore we'll keep on reviewing the position very carefully. The Prime Minister quite rightly has said we all need to just take care and watch the evidence about new variants.
