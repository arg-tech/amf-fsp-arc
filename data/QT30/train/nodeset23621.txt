Minette Batters[0:54:52] How, and the police do a fantastic job and I feel the police have paid a heavy price here for an inquiry that should have been called to see how the recruitment process failed catastrophically, there are evil people in the world. There will always, sadly, be evil people in the world, but that inquiry should have been called much, much earlier to find out how the recruitment process failed to allow a monster into the police force. The police do a great job and I feel they have had a collectively hard time over this, but that inquiry should have happened earlier.Fiona Bruce[0:55:28] It may have been tricky to have an inquiry before the trial. There could have been prejudicial issues there.AudienceMember 20211014QT52[0:55:40] Because the police can't get an arrest straightaway. They're not bothered about it. They have got to get their crime rates up...Fiona Bruce[0:55:50] It takes time to solve, you mean.AudienceMember 20211014QT53[0:55:54] Second, after this policeman got done, the media and other people, like the Government and everything, came out and said "oh" and the police were saying "maybe we should put undercover policemen". The women are going we don't want undercover policemen.Fiona Bruce[0:56:14] That was a suggestion about having under cover police officers in nightclubs.AudienceMember 20211014QT54[0:56:20] Yes.
