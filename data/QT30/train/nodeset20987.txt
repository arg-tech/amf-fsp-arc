Emma Unknown[00:05:20] Personally, it's putting me off being an SNP voter and I'm having to look at other options. I'm actually sat on my postal vote because I don't really know – how can you convince me that another referendum is in the best interests of the country?
Fiona Bruce[00:05:30] Okay. John?
John Unknown[00:05:34] I was curious to ask Douglas Ross – Blair asked a fairly straightforward question and Douglas failed to answer it, as he does so many times, he just went off on a tangent about independence – why don't you answer the question about if there's a majority in parliament, isn't that enough?
