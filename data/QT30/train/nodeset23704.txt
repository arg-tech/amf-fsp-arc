Fiona Bruce[0:03:39] Is it fair to take 20 pounds a week away from the poorest in society, Grant?
Grant Shapps[0:03:43] First of all, we all want to make sure that everyone in society has money to get through the coronavirus and get back into jobs, and that's why we spent over 400 billion pounds on families, on individuals, on businesses throughout the coronavirus, and we knew that when we included the uplift in universal credit, we said it was for a temporary period. It was during coronavirus, in the same way that furlough, for example, is coming to an end this month, because that was during the coronavirus, and one of the good things that's happened is we see more people in employment now than before coronavirus. We see more job opportunities, more job openings than even before coronavirus, in fact ever now, and we've seen salaries increase.
