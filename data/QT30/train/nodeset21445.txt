[FIONA BRUCE] : I can see -- there's still lots of hands up, we can talk about this for some time. We have other questions. I'm going to move on to Gary Day.
 
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Good evening, Panel. Looking forward to the 21 June decision on COVID restrictions. Considering there were no reported deaths on Tuesday, which scientific advice should the government take?
 
[FIONA BRUCE] : I notice that there were 12 deaths today reported in the latest 24 hour period. Andy?
 
[ANTHONY COSTELLO] : On the face of things, things look much better. We had this massive surge with the Kent variety, now called the alpha variant which has killed 60 plus thousand of citizens. Cases, deaths have all come back. Vaccine procurement and rollout has been very good because of the Oxford team and most important the NHS and primary care trusts. We all want our lives and livelihoods back. But we're still in the middle of a raging global pandemic. We have always argued from independent SAGE for a suppression policy rather than a herd policy which we think doesn't work.
