Robert Buckland[022:45] In 2011 Alex Salmond won an absolute majority in Holyrood. Now the SNP no doubt has done very well and we're not going to try and pussyfoot around the result, but they don't have an absolute majority. Yes, the Scottish Greens have indicated that they're in favour of a referendum.Fiona Bruce[00:23:05] Very strongly.Robert Buckland[00:23:07] But there is no consensus. The Scottish Labour Party don't agree, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Tories do not agree. And just think of the times in which we're living. We've all come through and are still coming through the most serious challenge to our health and our economy and our welfare in living memory. We're not out of the woods yet. Why on earth would you start contemplating constitutional and argue about issues of separation when the common priorities of the people of Scotland, the people of Northern Ireland, the people of Wales and England are to get through this crisis…Fiona Bruce[00:23:42] But the question is do they have a mandate.Robert Buckland[00:23:43] …and to get back on our feet.Fiona Bruce[00:23:44] Do they have a mandate, yes or no?Robert Buckland[00:23:46] I think that they've clearly won an impressive result. Do I think that they have established the consensus to have a referendum now? No, I don't.Fiona Bruce[00:23:55] The question is not do they have a consensus, the question is do they have a mandate, yes or no.Robert Buckland[00:24:00] I do not think that at the moment they should be pushing for a referendum. I think now is absolutely not the time.
