Fiona Bruce[0:55:00] Anneliese, summer schools, raised by Steph there, is that something you support?
Anneliese Dodds[0:55:06] We do feel there needs to be a lot of support for children to catch up. I mean, on average, they've lost -- what? -- over 100 days in schools, many of them. The summer school programme, as I understand it, it is going to be covering 1 in 3 children who received free school meals. This is a small scheme for those who might be keen on attending in the first place. I just think the government has this one wrong. I don't think they are facing up to the scale of the challenge.
