[LUCY FRAZER] : I'm sure they will be thinking about their reactions to that. But mental health is a big problem that we need to address. I think Heather was right to say we need to support young people in this. When I was on the Education Select Committee a number of years ago we did a report on mental health and how students were coping with it. I went to one of the schools in my constituency and I said I want you to ask me loads of questions about being an MP but do you mind if we spend the first minutes talking about mental health because I want to ask you the questions we're studying. In fact we spent the whole session on mental health because everybody wante to talk about it. So we do need to invest in schools, we need to support people in mental health and that is really, really important.
