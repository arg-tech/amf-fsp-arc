Fiona Bruce[0:17:16]And, Anthony, let me bring you in here. I mean, how is this looking to you on the other side of the Atlantic?
Anthony Scaramucci[0:17:21]Well, I’m going to light a novena candle and say thank god I’m not involved in British politics. I’ve got my own problems on this side of the pond. But here’s what I would say, and I mean this very respectfully to Chris, and because I’m relating to what Bonnie is saying about tokenism, and I think what we find in our society is that we have to break down the systemic and institutional racism. And so if the racists think you’re a racist, well, guess what, you’re a racist. And if the anti-Semites think you’re an anti-Semite you’re likely an anti-Semite. Even if you’re not doing it intentionally there are systemic and institutional biases, and I think the point that Bonnie’s making, which I’d like to hammer, is that you can’t say, well, one of my best friends is black therefore I’m not a racist. I mean, you just can’t do that. It’s tokenism. What we have to do is what Doctor Martin Luther King Junior said a long time ago is judge each other by the content of our character, not the colour of our skin. And, by the way, I grew up in a very patriarchal Italian American immigrant family, and so you’re also biased by the way you grow up and it’s important for you to seek that enlightenment and to make that transformation, and we need to do it as a culture and a civilisation, and it has to be at the institutional level. So it’s got to be at the Labour level and at the Conservative level, frankly.
