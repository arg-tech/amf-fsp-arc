Munira Wilson[0:42:19] Absolutely, but I think it's important to say, I don't agree with the means at all. The cause I do agree with, and I mean, Grant says, you know, we're a leader in climate change policies. I mean, these people are campaigning to insulate Britain. When the Liberal Democrats were in government between 2010 and 2015, we had a zero carbon home standard which was got rid of once the Tories were on their own, not a single zero carbon home has been built since then. We had an obligation on energy companies to pay for and support insulation of homes, that was scrapped, okay, so we needâ€¦the reason why energy bills are going up, apart from the fact that global prices have gone up is because our homes are not insulated very well at all, and therefore if we want to cut fuel poverty, if we want to cut bills, if we want to cut emissions, we need to have an emergency insulation programme. So I absolutely agree with their aims, but I don't agree with the means, and I think we've seen this week actually that the police have all the powers they need to deal with them. 
Grant Shapps[0:43:29] No, I'm saying the opposite.
