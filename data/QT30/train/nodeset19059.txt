Fiona Bruce [00:07:14] Lucas. 
Audience Speaker [00:07:16] None of the panelists have been able to answer, really, who has performed better, Nicola Sturgeon or Boris Johnson. Of course itâ€™s a horrendously difficult period for both of them. But why, and can they explain the disparity between public opinion and how they handled it? Clearly, people believe that Nicola Sturgeon has performed so much better.
Fiona Bruce [00:07:40] Grant, you have your hand up. 
Audience Speaker [00:07:42] I just wanted to follow on from what Douglas was saying and Lucas was saying. If both Holyrood and Westminster have both made mistakes there is a lesson to be learned for the UK government in the way the public are perceiving Holyrood and Nicola Sturgeon so favorably.
