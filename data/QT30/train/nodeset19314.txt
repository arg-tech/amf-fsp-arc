Fiona Bruce [00:11:26] Lots of hands. Beth. [Beth]: It has been a difficult year for everybody and I think news of this vaccine is a huge encouragement, the end is in sight. Also it is a very quick vaccine in the fact it has to be stored at -70C, it can’t be kept in the fridge like most normal ones can. Who’s going to be receiving it first in care homes and other facilities that perhaps aren’t geared to catering for this type of refrigeration, that could be an additional logistical challenge. But I think noticing the fact we’ve managed to produce this vaccine, scientists and research managed to produce this vaccine in a matter of months is a remarkable feat. I think the logistical side of it will be realistically easy compared to developing the vaccine in the first place. Fiona Bruce [00:12:20] Patrick? [Patrick]: This side of Christmas I think the logistics of delivery might go very well, hopefully. But given that the majority or a portion, at any rate, of the vaccines have to come from overseas, it is an unfortunate bit of timing occurring on December 31. That’s Brexit. I wonder if we can expect delays on deliveries after that date?
