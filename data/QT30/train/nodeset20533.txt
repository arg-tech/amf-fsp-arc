Audience Member 22[0:57:42] I have two children. When you say to them you lost all your school time, they get upset about it because they have been working hard. It is this thing about them having lost all this education; what they have lost is time with other children. They've lost that time to be children with other children. If there's anything that's going to happen over the summer, then it should be allowing children to be with other children and learning about being with other children. Having fun.
