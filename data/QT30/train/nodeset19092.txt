Kate Forbes second point is we are managing multiple harms. I don’t have in the Scottish government the fiscal leavers, I asked for them multiple times, I don’t have them or the financial resources because we’re not allowed to borrow to properly compensate employers. We’ve come, as you said to what is a cliff edge. There’s no way around it. The job support scheme is not a replacement for the furlough scheme. It disincentivises employers. We know from our own analysis it is going to cost tens of thousands of Scottish jobs which will be exacerbated right across the United Kingdom and ultimately employers need support. As Jim said earlier, hospitality has been through the most challenging of times. Businesses up and down the country have made enormous sacrifices, have invested, but right now with less resources and the cliff edge with furlough coming to an end, they have to make difficult choices. To me the message from the UK government is if there’s going to be the restrictions as we manage the harms, and with our primary objective of suppressing the virus, because that is the fastest way of getting back to some form of normality economically or socially, if we can suppress the virus, then we can re-start. One of the challenges was waiting for the chancellor to make an announcement on what they were going to do in terms of additional financial support.
