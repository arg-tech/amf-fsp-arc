Nadhim Zahawi[0:07:24] In additional welfare spending. As we headed up to Manchester, Hassan, we are an extra half a billion for those families and individuals who will find it hard this winter because of their utility bills and because of the need for additional support for food, and that will go through their Local Government, through councils who know them and are probably best placed to help them. So all that is happening. Plus, of course, remember the introduction of the National Living Wage. That's put £4,000 a year in additional money in people's pay packets. So, all that support, plus, of course, remember we've got kick-start and that is another £2 billion in the scheme to get people back to work. And restart which is £2.9 billion. So a lot of money is going into getting people who aren't in the workplace, into the workplace.
Fiona Bruce[0:08:24] Okay, well, let's see what our aud make of that.
Nadhim Zahawi[0:08:28] We are doing the right thing as we transition out of Covid. The economy is in a good place to deliver.
