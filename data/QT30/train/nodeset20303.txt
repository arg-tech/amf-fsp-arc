Fiona Bruce[0:13:16] The variant is present in 35 other countries not on the list.
Stephen Fitzpatrick[0:13:22] Which variant in are we going to protect against all future variants we don't know about? The point is I honestly believe we have to start to balance the interests of public health with private freedoms and all of the other aspects of our lives. I can tell you there are many other threats to our livelihoods and to our lives than Covid-19 and I see only a one-dimensional approach to this.
Audience Member[0:13:50] As an island nation we had the opportunity to learn, we were slightly ahead of the curve, we can't have learned from New Zealand and Australia. They managed to close their entire country borders, in between states. We have done nothing about it and we've had the worse death rate in Europe. It's an absolute scandal. This should have been at the outset, close the borders, stop the virus coming in and contain it. Instead we've had almost a year's worth now of open/close, start/stop, lockdown and various restrictions. It is too slow, too little, and too late. It is still a botched job because now we're going to create a border between England and Scotland, never mind with Ireland.
