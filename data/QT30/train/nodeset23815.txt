[0:24:02] (18) Regarding the preparedness of this government, when all this took place, the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister were on holiday, sitting on the beach. I mean, it is incredible that that should be the case. I mean, how prepared were they that they felt it was okay to go on holiday, knowing, as you say, 18 months ago, the state was coming, this was going to happen, and this should have been organised? And, for them today, I was watching the debate in parliament, and Dominic Raab, finding it amusing when people are asking him questions about this. It is absolutely so disgraceful. They should hang their heads in shame. It is disgraceful. [Applause].

[0:24:50] (19) The United Kingdom played a massive part in getting itself involved. For us to be talking about allowing only 5,000 people a year this is quite frankly disgusting. We should say our arms are open to whoever wants to come and whenever they want a safe return, they can have a safe return and support them in doing so. To say 5,000 a year is just ridiculous.
