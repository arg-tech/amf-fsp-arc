Fiona Bruce[0:44:38] Do you think he should go to the States?
Lisa Nandy[0:44:40] For a lot of people, a lot of women who don't see justice done, in this country, rape conviction is at their lowest level ever in this country. For a lot of women looking at the system, especially at the moment given everything that's happened over the last few months and especially what we've learnt about the killing of Sarah Everard in the last few weeks, for a lot of women in this country, they want to know that nobody is beyond the law.

AudienceMember 20211014QT40[0:45:12] No one is above the law including Prince Andrew. I don't think it should be a question of should he go to the US or not, like nobody is above the law.

AudienceMember 20211014QT41[0:45:24] Thank you. I agree entirely with what Lisa Nandy said. It is a question of supporting women who are obviously coming forward with accusations that need to be followed through. I just wanted to say there have been 81 women murdered by a man since Sarah Everard died on 3rd March and in 2014, Her Majesty's inspectors of constabulary recommended that all police forces should have domestic abuse training.
