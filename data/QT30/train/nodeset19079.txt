Audience Speaker 1 [00:25:14] Can the panel please explain to me, following on from Martin’s question, how the government is going to expect providers in the hospitality sector like pubs and wine bars to be able to pay wages of 20 percent when businesses have closed and transpires no money coming in. It doesn’t add up. 

Fiona Bruce [00:25:32] Graham. 

Audience Speaker 2 [00:25:34] Again, increased lockdown the level of differences across the four nations is adding to the confusion. Is it a case that actually it is a rule for some but not for me because I’ll pretend I’m in Cardiff for the purposes of the meeting I’m having or the lunch I’m having. It is too difficult for people to interpret the rules. It is too easy for them to interpret it for themselves. So looking at the SAGE advice and making the lockdown nationwide has to be the way forward. 

Fiona Bruce [00:26:02] Colin. 

Audience Speaker 3 [00:26:04] I think there’s a point being missed by a lot of the panel that Mark only just mentioned at the end of his point. The lockdown is supposed to be time to break the chain of infection and give time to bring up the testing and tracing system to a suitable level so that that takes over and bring down the levels. Why are we not hearing enough about that?
