Fiona Bruce [00:23:56] As a scientist, help us understand. Is it to make sense scientifically that the rules are different in these different areas? Mark Walport [00:24:04] The first thing to say is there is not a perfect science that says -- you know, there isn’t a science that says what a restaurant is or a café. Nor is this a specific science that says 6 people or 5 people or 7 people. What has to happen is that our social distancing has to be maintained. Of course, we are all in this together. Everyone has a responsibility here. But the rules have to be clear and I think the argument for a circuit breaker is it is tough but short. If we can, by a month’s time, get the numbers down, then we have to get testing and tracing on top of it rather than chasing behind. At the moment, although the numbers number of available tests has gone up, it is still chasing demand. We are only going to decrease if we get on top of it. Then we can really focus on outbreak control, on testing in environments where the risk is hiring and testing in the health system. That’s what we have to do. Fiona Bruce [00:25:00] Your advice would be to shut them all together for a brief period or for a period of whatever length? Mark Walport [00:25:08] For a brief period of time we have to get this under control. There’s no question about that.
