Nelufar Hedayat[0:17:16] The solution is not just to remove the brightest and the best of Afghanistan. The last time this happened, to your point: the last time this happened, I happened. I left the country I was born in, and I came here. And I'm a proud Brit. I'm a tax-paying citizen, I try to do good, I give to charity, I work in my civil community, I vote, I do all those things. But I could have done all of this where I'm from. I could have done of this in Afghanistan. So just to remove everyone that we worked with that that was the brightest and the best is not a total solution. All solutions should be on the table - I'm not saying they shouldn't - but moving a few thousand - 5,000, that's how many we expect to bring over the next year. What does that number mean? Does that satisfy anyone here?
Fiona Bruce[0:18:00] We have a question on this. Let's hear from Bethany.
AudienceMember 20210902QT22[0:18:04] (17) So how many refugees should the UK accept from Afghanistan?
Fiona Bruce[0:18:08] Has Labour put a number on this?
Lisa Nandy[0:18:12] No, and one of the reasons we haven't put a number on this because it depends in part on the scale of the crisis about to unfold so we don't know what that is yet. We've said the government should make a big and generous offer, we said they should prioritise those people who are being targeted by the Taliban.
