Fiona Bruce [00:43:04] The question is about school closures. In our panel, Nicola, you are a teacher. What’s your view of Amanda’s question. Was the government right to wait until the first day of term to announce the closures? 
[Nicola]: I think there’s no doubt they weren’t correct. We could see in schools that numbers were rising and that teachers and students were struggling to be in school and struggling to staff school and struggling to feel safe and provide the education that we need to. I would like to agree with what’s been said about Gavin Williams. I think today, again, you know, we saw very vague announcements about exam grades and that just leads to more stress for our young people. They have had such a lot to put up with. They just had more uncertainty today.[DONE] 
Fiona Bruce [00:43:58] Nadhim, I assume you want to defend your colleague because clearly there has been a lot of criticism of Gavin Williams. What was that about, really, saying on Sunday schools are absolutely safe. The kids go on Monday and by the end of Monday saying, hang on, we’re going to completely change our mind, no, they’re not safe after all.
