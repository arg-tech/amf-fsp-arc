Fiona Bruce[0:02:04] Interesting. A whole array of hands shot up as you were talking. So you are saying, David, you would have done the same thing. Andy.Andy Burnham[0:02:14] I don't agree with David on this. I do think so, you need a prime minister to lead from the front at any time but particularly during a pandemic when extraordinary things are being asked of people, when families are not seeing loved ones who are dying in hospital, that is exactly the moment that the Prime Minister needs to set the standards that the country has to live by. Otherwise, it all falls apart. I think that's where we're getting to. This idea of one rule for them, one rule for everyone else, was introduced by the handling of the Dominic Cummings trip to Barnard Castle, but it is being reinforced by the way the last few days have played out.
