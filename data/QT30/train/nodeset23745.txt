Richard Walker[0:46:02] Ultimately what we need is a more diverse greener resilient energy mix, and it's not a binary choice of fossil energy or non-fossil energy. We have the biggest tidal stream in the world…
Kate Andrews[0:46:12] But if you speak to the people on the M25, they may not like your nuanced answer, if my point.
Richard Walker[0:46:14] …why aren't we world leading in those? There's a whole load of other stuff, hydrogen, you know, we're already…
Kate Andrews[0:46:18] Yeah, nuclear.
Richard Walker[0:46:19] …we have amazing R and D, we need to scale that up. Let's talk about micro nuclear, there's all sorts of things we should be scaling up.
Kate Andrews[0:46:22] Speak to people on the M25 and they might not agree with your relatively nuanced position on this, that's what I'm saying.
Grant Shapps[0:46:27] Slightly off the actual question which was about whether it was right for people to go on the M25 rather than the power supply, but both the other politicians on the panel have mentioned the police already having the powers. That was evidently not the case when the same people who were protesting on the first day were out on the third day and then on the fifth day, having been arrested each time in between. The reason I had to take an injunction was it was the only way to make that contempt of court and therefore imprisonable, and supporting the Police and Crime Bill would actually hope folks, but neither of these guys are doing that.
