[0:46:58] There are clear dates being put in place to see if we can hold people accountable to their commitments. If we don't do that, we have a serious problem. But the issue is this, even with the current commitments, we are far removed from what we really need to stay below 1.5 degrees. We need 20 times more on electric cars. We're talking here about the biggest transformation of our global economy since the Industrial Revolution, which started here in Glasgow, by the way. Now, coming to the cost. I think for the first time people are starting to realise that the cost of not accounting now is infinitely higher than the cost of acting. COVID has shown us that we can't have healthy people on an unhealthy planet. We have spent 60 trillion to save livelihoods. The IMS estimates we lost $27 trillion in the global economy. Guest what, most of that cost is borne by the people that already kept the wrong stick of society in loading their jobs, losing their lives, in not having a safety net around them. So governments are starting to understand and businesses are starting to understand this is probably the biggest and best business opportunity that we have in front of us.
