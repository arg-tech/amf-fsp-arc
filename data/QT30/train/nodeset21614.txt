Daniel Finkelstein[0:52:00] I'm not an expert on farming, but I do buy the product. And you have to look at it from both ends, not just the production but also the people who buy it. The reason -- the only reason why it could possibly be a threat to farming in this country is if consumers choose to buy this product rather than the ones being proud here.
Fiona Bruce[0:52:22] Which they may if it is cheaper.
Daniel Finkelstein[0:52:26] The whole point of trade is somebody swaps something for something else. You can't lose in a trade, that's the whole point of trading. Therefore, my starting position is I like deals which reduce tariffs. It is ridiculous to suggest that this is going to make any difference compared to leaving the single market of the European Union. It won't even achieve even a tiny increase in production that the government is talking about. It will probably be -- it is going to be close to zero, the impact on GDP, but I can't be against it because reducing the costs of goods so that we produce the things we're best at producing, others produce the things they are best at producing, and the consumer gets a good deal on both, has to be a good thing.
