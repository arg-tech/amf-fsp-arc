Bonnie Greer[0:32:09]That’s why I gave you your respect at the beginning, Anthony. That’s why I did that. Okay.
Anthony Scaramucci[0:32:11]No, and I appreciate that, but I want everybody to know that’s watching the show you have to be very careful with your decision making because you can get your pride and ego involved with your decision making and then your emotions are going up and your intelligence is going down, and for me, I had a self-narrative that was ego based, I grew up in this blue power family, I had some measure of financial success in the United States and I wanted to work in that White House, and I was normalising the President because I said, okay, he’s the successor of Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower, he can’t actually be this crazy…
Bonnie Greer[0:32:45]But he was.
Anthony Scaramucci[0:32:46]…because I was overriding rationality. I have to own that, and I’m just telling that as a cautionary tale for others, try to put your pride and ego aside when you’re making decisions that are political or relationship based or in your business.
Fiona Bruce[0:33:00]Paula.
Female Aud 2[0:33:02]Thank you, Fiona. I hear what Anthony is saying and it seems that some Republicans are getting buyer’s remorse and regretting that Donald Trump is their representative in the presidential race, but they’ve had opportunities through impeachment and others to, as it were, remove him. Why didn’t they take them? Did they put wanting to hold onto power ahead of what was good for their country?
Bonnie Greer[0:33:26]Yes.
