Fiona Bruce[0:21:49] So what should the government be doing?

Munira Wilson[0:21:50] So I agree that there should beâ€¦they should be looking at a visa solution to be able to bring in migrant workers. It's clear that with the immigration changes I think with COVID, lots of European drivers went home, and they haven't come back again, so putting in place a visa route for them to be able to come back, I think is important, but there are also long term changes in the labour market, as I think Richard alluded to, and we know some of the tax changes around self-employment, for instance, and the demographic changes in that workforce are meaning that this is not a short term problem, and what we need to see for a just in time supply chain is some long term planning, but unfortunately we've got a just in time government that tends to lurch from crisis to crisis. 

We need to do some proper contingency planning around our workforce. This isn't just about HGV drivers, we're seeing shortages in our farms, in picking and packing food, as well as getting it onto supermarket shelves. And we know that it might not be the case for Iceland, but for some other supermarkets, we know there's been about a drop in a quarter of the fulfilment of their deliveries on their shelves, and that will mean that probably we'll all have far less choice this Christmas.
