Kirsty[0:25:34] I was just worning, this is kind of aimed at Steve, because I feel like particularly it's been raised by the pandemic, there is more opportunities for people to work on-line, and with everything going on at the moment, I feel like self employment should actually be encouraged and I don't feel like the conservative Government are actually encouraging people andity particularly /KRUPBG err of -- I get off my own back and do a lot of things and I feel like we should be encouraging self-employment and small businesses more.
