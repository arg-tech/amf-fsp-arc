Fiona Bruce[0:08:56] The man here.AudienceMember 20211014QT07[0:09:00] I agree totally with you, Lisa. This government has been in power for 10 years. We must not kid ourselves. An example was Therese Coffey, that video was insulting to all those poor people who are losing their money at this moment. I mean, the incompetence...Fiona Bruce[0:09:26] What video are you referring to? The one of her dancing at the conference.Lisa Nandy[0:09:32] She was singing "I've had the time of my life" while people lost thousands out of their pocket.AudienceMember 20211014QT08[0:09:40] The Tories keep spouting we're the party of economic competence. It is laughable. Where we are today, debt has gone up considerably. They keep saying we like to reduce the debt. It has quadrupled. They go to businesses and say "you're to blame by this." It is incompetence and it is irrational and people must see what Boris is doing. He is a clown, a joker and he is a showman. That's what it is. We need real leadership and my personal opinion, I'm seeing what Keir did last week, that's where your leadership is. We must trust in new leaders, that's my opinion. (APPLAUSE).Fiona Bruce[0:10:20] The man in the pink.AudienceMember 20211014QT09[0:10:24] I think the Universal Credit uplift and then a downlift is the most idiotic thing I can imagine.Fiona Bruce[0:10:34] The Government always said it was going to be temporary.AudienceMember 20211014QT10[0:10:38] Yes, they did, but if you give somebody something and they get used to it and you take it away, that's a big blow, especially when there is going to be inflation that's rampant in this country over the next few months. Whatever the gas prices. Whatever the haulage crisis, that money should not have been given if it is going to be taken away. It creates a bad feeling, not even those who have it taken away, but people who like me, who don't need it, but didn't get it.
