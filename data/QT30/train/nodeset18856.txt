Jed Mercurio[00:17:36] We need safety to be achieved through having a functioning test and trace system, and low levels of transmission, because it’s not just about it being safe for kids to go back to school, it has to be safe for society. They travel, they interact with staff; those staff members interact with people in their households and possibly the disease can be transmitted to vulnerable people. So, there has been a total failure to deliver on the promises, and that’s caused a great deal of confusion.
James Cleverly[00:18:10] Well, I’m going to have to disagree with you on the point you’re making about the requirement for test and trace and the planning around that and the delivery of that. We’ve got…we now have a testing system which tests huge numbers of people on a daily basis, hundreds of thousands of people. And that was driven forward…Matt Hancock set himself some incredibly challenging targets to expand that.
Fiona Bruce[00:18:37] Well, James, I think we might get onto this in more detail in a moment.
James Cleverly[00:18:42] Okay. Oh no, I’m… Yeah, okay.
Fiona Bruce[00:18:43] No, that’s absolutely fine. I’ve just noticed there’s some hands up in the audience. Tony, you had your hand up?
