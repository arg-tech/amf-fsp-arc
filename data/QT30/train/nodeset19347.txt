Fiona Bruce [00:37:32] If it is not a question of money, what do you suggest it is?[DONE] Liam Halligan [00:37:36] I think we need to lock down in a much more granular fashion, more geographical specific. It is often poohed-poohed but I think there’s a case for age stratification. Letting the younger generation get out there, do their thing, shielding the elderly if they want to be shielded. People say that’s impossible because there are multi-generational households.9 percent of all households, people of working age, do not live with anyone over 65 where the vast majority of Covid fatalities and Covid cases occur. We can use unused hotels where you have multi-generational families so workers aren’; coming home and, in the unfortunate phrase “killing their granule I didn’t say.” It’s not money we’re spending every day in the terms of furlough and business support, it is the taxes we’re not raising. Unless we’re going to have a major economic overhang going on for years and years and years and a difficulty of funding infrastructure, all the things we need going forward, we have to get our economy moving again.
