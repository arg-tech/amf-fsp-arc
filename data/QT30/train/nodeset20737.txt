Fiona Bruce[0:15:16] Is the issue it's not men like you that are the problem. The men who wouldn't be asking those questions.
AudienceMember 20210318QT12[0:15:22] I hope it's not me is the problem.
Fiona Bruce[0:15:26] I'm sure you're not.
AudienceMember 20210318QT13[0:15:28] Certainly women might feel intimidated by me if I have my headphones in, I walk up behind them and they don't know who I am, or I'm jogging past or on my bike. The fear is we live in a society now where most people you walk past are anonymous to you. You'll never see them again. We need to be more courteous to each other in public spaces so everybody feels safer.

AudienceMember 20210318QT14[0:15:56] I agree with everything that has been said so far, particularly about the education of people, particularly young men. But also, a very important factor is everybody would feel a lot safer if we had a more visible police presence on our streets. If you go to any major European capital, you see more police on street corners, in squares that are visible. I think it is a reassuring thing to see police on our streets as a form of protection for us all. Unfortunately, I feel in the UK now our police force has become more reactionary. That they respond to telephone calls after an event rather than being visible and being there to protect us, you know, at the moment something happens.
