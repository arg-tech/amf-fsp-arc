Fiona Bruce[00:08:02] And where's it lost its appeal then?Paul Mason[00:08:04] Well, I'll tell you where it's lost its appeal. First of all, where it's lost its appeal is in the small towns that me and Lisa both come from that have been left behind by 30 years of free market economics, absolutely, because it's failed to represent them. It has failed to represent them. I'm from, as I said, a Labour heartland. I want us to reach out back to the places we come from and prove to those voters that if we carry on with a bunch of corrupt super-rich people running this country there's nothing in it for them.Robert Buckland[00:08:33] You see, this is the problem. The Labour Party is very good at telling us what it doesn't like. It's very good at telling us what the divisions are in our country. What it's useless at is actually coming up with prescriptions. They're having a conversation amongst themselves at the moment, Fiona, they're not in a position even to begin a conversation with the country, because frankly they don't know what they want.Lisa Nandy[00:08:55] This is unbelievable. From a party that had a former prime minister in Parliament today talking about a corruption scandal at the heart of government, the cosy financial relationships that allowed people to take risks and win big and when they lost it was people in Hartlepool and Rotherham who shouldered the appalling losses.
