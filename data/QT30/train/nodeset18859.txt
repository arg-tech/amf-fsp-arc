Tony[00:18:48] Yes, hello. One of the things that bugs me about all this is, everything comes down to that government has to have a plan, and the government does have to have a plan but some of the ideas that come through are frankly just incomprehensible. I was just listening today to somebody saying, the problem is, we don’t have enough space. We can open hotels, we can put up marquees and that way we can get more kids back into school. Great idea; begs the question where are the teachers, because we wouldn’t have enough teachers to do that, and those teachers we have got about 40 per cent of them don’t want to go back anyway.
Fiona Bruce[00:19:30] Sue?
Sue[00:19:31] We all know that education is a great social leveller and a great force for social mobility, and with rising inequality in the UK the fact that these children… The question was whether six months off school is devastating for a whole generation and for those children who have no access to the internet, have no computers at school, have no books on the book shelves behind them, these are the children who are particularly suffering from this. And until we have, I’m sorry to repeat it, but effective tracing in place…testing and tracing, we can’t get there. We cannot have, like on the Isle of Wight, 90 per cent of those people who are traced disappearing into the ether.
