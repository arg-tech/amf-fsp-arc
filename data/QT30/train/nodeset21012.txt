Fiona Bruce[00:20:02] Okay. Moira, you had your hand up?Moira Unknown[00:20:05] Yeah, can you hear me?Fiona Bruce[00:20:07] We can.Moira Unknown[00:20:09] It just amazes me how they're always saying that Scotland's worse off. If you look at England as a whole, and other parts of the UK, I think that Scotland does quite well with our health service. The vaccination programme is better. There may be a problem with drugs but I don't believe that it's that much worse than in England, and it's always talked about it because the drug problems worse here. There's a lot more things worse. Homelessness, that's why there's so many people on the streets â€“ what else have they got to turn to? They turn to drugs but that's not just exclusive to Scotland, it's all over.Fiona Bruce [00:20:42] Well, just in terms of the drugs deaths, the figures are considerably worse for Scotland, I'm afraid, that is just a fact.
