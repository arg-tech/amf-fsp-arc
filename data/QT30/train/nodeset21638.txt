David Davis[0:01:30] I think I would have done the same thing, frankly, in those circumstances. But let's be clear, the right outcome happened, Hancock went, he had to go. What he had done was wrong, what he did was horrible for all the people that had to live through the traumatic circumstances of small funerals and weddings, seeing their close relatives die without being able to say goodbye, that sort of thing. They will all have felt really, really angry. So he couldn't stay. But I don't think Boris should have done much different.
