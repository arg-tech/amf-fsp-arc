[00:52:22] Okay. I'm going to take one more question quickly, we're almost out of time. But a number of people suggested this. Charlie, Charlie Owen.

Charlie Unknown
[00:52:30] Hi. Do you have any recommendations on how to hug cautiously?

Fiona Bruce
[00:52:39] Paul?

Paul Mason
[00:52:42] It's hugging day, isn't it, coming up, and I think we all know what we're talking about. Lots of young people who don't live in families haven't been able to date, haven't been able to meet each other. I would say, no, don't be cautious to those who are being allowed to hug for the first time on next Monday.

Fiona Bruce
[00:53:03] Michelle?

Michelle Dewberry
[00:53:04] How to hug cautiously, probably get a partner who annoys you as much as my partner annoys me, then you probably would never want to hug them, you wouldn't need guidance of caution, I can tell you.

Fiona Bruce
[00:53:15] Is he going to be watching this, Michelle?

Michelle Dewberry.
[00:53:16] I'm only joking. But joking aside, joking side, do you know what, we have been denied human touch and connection and we cannot underestimate what that has done to people's mental health. If you want to go hug somebody, and it's a good job I'm not in government because I would be in trouble for saying this, just go hug them. Use your common sense, get involved and just feel good again, that's what we need.
