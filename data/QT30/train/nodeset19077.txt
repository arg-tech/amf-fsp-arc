[00:11:32] Ian, there’s a great reluctance to answer the question put. We must try to do it justice. Do you think this pandemic has been managed better by Nicola Sturgeon than Boris Johnson? 
 
Ian Wood 
[00:11:46] I honestly think it is the wrong question. 

Fiona Bruce 
[00:11:48] But it is the question, that is the thing. 

Ian Wood 
[00:11:52] Right now we are faced with probably the biggest health crisis the world has ever had. That’s applying across the world. All countries are facing a myriad of problems. I think in Scotland’s case our biggest tragedy was the care homes. I think generally we’re undoubtedly in the first wave restarted too quickly. We tried started too quickly. We now have a huge second wave. With the students coming back in the way they did, I hate to say this, but I think it was a bad decision. 

Fiona Bruce 
[00:12:26] You think the universities should have stayed closed? 

Ian Wood 
[00:12:28] Not closed but done online. Perfectly feasible. The real question is what do we do now? How do we keep working at this problem and get past the second wave? That’s what we should be concentrating on. We spend far too much time in Scotland and the UK arguing who is right and who is wrong. We have to make some clear decisions and try to get the next stage right.
