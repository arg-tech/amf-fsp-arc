FIONA BRUCE [00:26:00] Ellie. 

ELLIE UNKNOWN [00:26:00] Are we aware of what other countries are doing in regards to the vaccine? Is there much liaison going on with the World Health Organisation? Obviously, China was first affected and, you know, how far are this advanced in interpreters of coming along with a vaccine? Is there much communication there? 

FIONA BRUCE [00:26:22] Let me get a few questions then we’ll won’t put them to Matt and David as well. Marie. 

MARIE UNKNOWN [00:26:28] I was just wondering whether the government foresee any potential supply issues after Brexit at the epidemic of the year and whether that will cause any transportation issues with the vaccine coming into the UK. 

FIONA BRUCE [00:26:42] I think we might come to that point in a moment. I’m going to park that -- “park it”, that’s been one of the big issues. Eammon.
EAMMON UNKNOWN [00:26:58] I think Matt is underestimating the massive challenges that we’re going to have with the supply and distribution of this product. Because I have seen firsthand with the flu vaccination campaign this flu season, we’ve had massive issues with pharmacies running out of stock, using up their stock quite quickly and not being able to replenish that stock. GP surgeries being out of stock for -- having to wait for more than a month to get new stock in.[DONE]
