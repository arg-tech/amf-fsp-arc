Fiona Bruce [00:30:52] Sue, you had your hand up.
 [Sue]: Sorry, I was going to ask the same question Jim asked earlier. 
 Fiona Bruce [00:31:02] Let’s hear from Dave. 
[Dave]: For me we just keep constantly looking backwards and not forwards. We keep blaming government, the opposition blame government, we blame the public. We blame all sorts of people and we are constantly looking backwards. We’re constantly saying look, this should have happened, that should have happened, we should have put this into place. We need to be looking forward, not backward. All the evaluation, all the criticism can be in the future. But now we need to be looking forward. We need to establish a way and a means to go forward with this and then we can, you know, have all the reflection and all the evaluation afterwards. Too many people, in my opinion, constantly are looking backwards and I think we really do need to go forwards.[DONE]
