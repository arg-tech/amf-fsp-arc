Fiona Bruce[0:45:14] Let me bring in Lisa. Lisa has not had a chance to answer this question. The question is higher casualties, trillions spent, what was the war in Afghanistan for? This is the war that Labour supported.
Lisa Nandy[0:45:26] It's impossible to look at the situation that is unfolding in front of our eyes and think this is anything other than a catastrophe. Having said that, those mistakes that have been made, the very many mistakes, including the failure to plan for what came next after our exit strategy, which we have raised repeatedly in the House of Commons, and with ministers over recent months, those failures were political and strategic. They were not the failures and mistakes of the very many people led by Afghans themselves, with British troops supporting them, with humanitarian and aid workers from all over the world, including Afghanistan supporting them, and here in the UK, and the very many diplomats and staff and civilian contractors who worked as well, to deliver benefits that so many panellists have talked about. The clearance of land-mines, which nobody has mentioned, which gave a dramatic boost, not just to the safety of people in Afghanistan, but to the economic prospects of people in Afghanistan as well.
