Fiona Bruce[00:31:42] Quite a few hands up here. Charlie, let's hear from you.
Charlie Unknown[00:31:45] Thank you. I was just listening to Nick then and I think what he's saying is fundamentally wrong about the risk. However, generally I do think privatisation is a positive thing, but in this case, in the railways, it just hasn't worked. It's been a problem ever since it was brought in as a rush job at the end of the Major government. I was working in the legal sector when it came in 20 odd years ago, and the amount of fees that were generated by dealing with the private companies to get the rolling stock, to get everythingâ€¦ I mean, there was money just spewing out all over the place. If we can bring it back, let's just bring it back and let's make it sensible.
Fiona Bruce[00:32:32] Okay. When you say bring it back do you mean bring it back into public ownership?
Charlie Unknown[00:32:37] More so, yes. Although I'm a great fan of privatisation I just don't think it works on the railways.
