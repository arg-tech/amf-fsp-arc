Fiona Bruce[00:26:48] And do you think here in the UK, we should vaccinate our own population first before we start exporting vaccines? Vaughan Gething[00:26:53] Yes, I think that's exactly what we're going to do becauseâ€¦Fiona Bruce[00:26:54] That is what we're going to do? Vaughan Gething[00:26:55] Yes, because we've got contracts and supplies that are coming in, we've a real success story here in Wales, every UK nation can be proud of its own vaccination programme, it's just a matter of fact that we have done even better than other countries. We're going faster than elsewhere. That's a real matter of pride and we're going to finish the job with the vaccines we've got. But I fully expect that there will be help from the UK to other parts of the world, but everyone just needs to calm down, because members of the public rolling in and saying it's the Europeans, it's the Brits, well, I just think that's really unhelpful. It's about getting supplies to all parts of the world as quickly as possible, and I have conversations with Conservative ministers about this, people who are my opponents politically but we have grown-up conversations and I speak with the vaccine companies themselves as well. So it's about how quickly we can all go to make us all safe.
