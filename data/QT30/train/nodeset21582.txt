[0:19:22] More people would die.

Mark Harper
[0:19:24] The problem is this problem is going to be with us forever. The scientific officer said that. If we are being honest with people, vaccines are not 100 percent perfect. If you want to wait for a 100 percent perfect vaccine, you'll be waiting forever. The fact is at some point we have to get back to normal. I'm afraid, the brutal truth is some people will get COVID even if they have been vaccinated, and of those people some people will become ill. I'm afraid some people will die.

Fiona Bruce
[0:19:54] Far fewer if more people are vaccinated.

Mark Harper
[0:19:58] Of course. In the same way we get 15,000 people die of seasonal flew.

Sarah Jones
[0:20:04] You were saying that November.

Mark Harper
[0:20:08] The difference is we have a successful vaccine. The only piece of information that we learned this week that we didn't know when we were going to unlock on 21 June is that the vaccines are fantastically successful, including against the delta variant. My worry is this, if you look at what the government set out yesterday and what we were voting on, the four-week delay is to collect data to make another decision and test. It is not a guaranteed end date at all. The problem is 96 percent of people already had two doses in those risk groups.
