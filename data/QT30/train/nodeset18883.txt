Fiona Bruce[00:46:53] Tony. So, I will come back to you, James, sorry, forgive me, I will allow you to come back in. Tony?
Tony[00:46:59] I’m afraid, all this carries on. I have a right to my expression as well and the black population puts itself about… The Black Lives Matter movement is excellent but they do themselves no favours when they riot in London. There is plenty of government legislation for racial equality. The government have done a lot to try and make sure that we have racial equality; it’s the people that get it wrong. And I’m afraid, a lot of the time the way that the Black Lives Matter movement conducts itself does them no good at all, it does them no favours. 
Fiona Bruce[00:47:54] Well, Tony, as I’m sure you know, there was violence but it was from a minority of people, and there were huge amounts of peaceful protests on the streets as well. Belinda?
