Sarah Jones[0:09:02] The problem is twofold. There's a shortfall in care workers at the moment and we risk putting vulnerable people in a worse situation if they don't have care from people who are leaving the system. The other problem is those who are vaccine-hesitant have strong views that they feel strongly, are not necessarily going to be affected by the government telling them they have to have a vaccine. So I'm not convinced and the Labour Party is not convinced that this will work. We need to look at places like Wales where they have a higher level of vaccination amongst workers, where it is about education, it is about making sure people can take time off work if they need to, that they are confident that they can take time off work if they are poorly after they had the vaccine, and it is about informing and enabling people to get the outcome. But the outcome must be that everybody gets the vaccination. That's what we're aiming for. I'm not sure this is the way to do it.
