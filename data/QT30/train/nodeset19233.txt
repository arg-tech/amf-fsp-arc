Part 28
FIONA BRUCE [00:53:24] Can you even tell us when people might first get the vaccine? 
MATT HANCOCK [00:53:28] Well, we’re planning that if all goes well, including the safety coming through, and including the manufacturing going well by Pfizer, we’re planning to be able to roll out from the start of December, which isn’t long. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:53:42] One of the cofounders of the company manufacturing this vaccine said not before mid-December. You’re not on the same page there. 
MATT HANCOCK [00:53:50] As I say, we’re planning to be ready from 1 December but we are not guaranteeing that by any stretch. It would be easier in the moment for me to say: No problem, it’s all sorted. We’re not there yet. But what we can say is we’re making progress towards where we need to be but there are many, many hurdles still for us to go over.[DONE]
