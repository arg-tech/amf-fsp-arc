AudienceMember 20210624QT14[0:07:10] Thanks, Fiona. Yeah, ethically it is a very, very difficult one to try to sort out. One of the things I'm personally feeling is how and why do we feel the need to actually force people and almost twist their hands behind their back in saying if you don't get it you haven't got a job? That is ethically wrong. You know, where do we stop? Do we go to the police service? Do we go to the fire service? Do we go to the ambulance service? I work with elderly people as well within the outdoor sector. Will I have -- yes, I've had the vaccine, I've had both, I'm very fortunate. But where do we stop with this. That's what's ethically wrong aspect of it.
