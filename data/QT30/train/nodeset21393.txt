Fatima Bhula[00:28:36] Thank you. Is Great British Railways just another headline grabbing gimmick or will it actually make rail travel cheaper and more efficient?
Fiona Bruce[00:28:46] So this is the announcement today by the government that Network Rail is effectively going to be subsumed over a period of time into Great British Railways which will also take charge, not only just of the infrastructure of the railways, but also of ticketing and timetables, certainly in England and Wales. Going to be slightly different in Scotland. Harriet, another gimmick? Is this going to make much of a difference?
Harriet Green[00:29:11] I think firstly it appears from what's been shared that the commuters were really listened to. So I think it's always good when people are actually using the service are consulted, and it seemed a very intensive set of what are the issues we're dealing with.
