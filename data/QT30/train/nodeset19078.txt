Miriam Brett [00:13:58] I think you’ve hit the nail on the head there. One of the clearest distinctions between the two approaches -- and I think it is important to recognize here here that we had a four-nations approach beforehand which veered off path when Boris Johnson decided to, in my opinion, pre-emptively eased lockdown and have since seen a four-nations approach. I think on your point on messaging that’s key. When 80 percent of people in Scotland said the Scottish government had good communications. 72 percent of people in Scotland says the UK government has bad communication strategy just now. That gets to one of the key distinctions there. More broadly, though, I think one of the key issues that we need to address in terms of our handling of this crisis more broadly is the scale of outsourcing that we have seen throughout this entire pandemic. We are seeing consultants being brought in for a week who are being paid a year’s worth of nurses’ salaries. We are seeing Deloitte, Mackenzie, being brought in, firms looking to maximise profit and do not have expertise in public health are being brought in to oversee how we respond to test, track and trace. Now, that for me is an abject failure. Why should the taxes of key workers, who are trying so hard just now to help alleviate this crisis, line the pockets of corporations who are not experts in public health? So for me, what we need to do, if it is the case that we are recommended to have a circuit break, if it is recommended to have another lockdown, we need to take a moment, step back, reassess our current approach and recognise that public health should be in public hands and use that as the mantra going forward to guide us.
