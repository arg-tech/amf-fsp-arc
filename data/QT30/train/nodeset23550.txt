[00:29:15] This is a culture change, a shift that we need in this country. We need to educate men into the dangers that women face going out, that they shouldn't face. As Anas said, you shouldn't be afraid to go about your business, go on a night out and feel scared to go home or feel scared to ask a policeman for help, or whatever it is. And so we do need a culture shift. 

We should also be clear that these men who are going into clubs and spiking these drinks, or using hypodermic needles, or EpiPens, as you suggest, these are vile, pernicious individuals who are going to take advantage of young vulnerable women and they should get everything thrown at them that we can throw at them in this country. But yes, we need an education shift, we need a culture shift, and we, as men, to be much more aware of the dangers that so many women in this country feel that they face going about their daily business.
