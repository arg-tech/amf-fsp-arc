Fiona Bruce[0:12:10] And, Marie, can I ask you, because, I mean, Jeremy Corbyn has said again today that he’s not anti-Semitic, that anyone who says there was not a problem with antisemitism in Labour is wrong. But the question from David is should just one individual be held to account?Marie van der Zyl[0:12:25] It’s a question also of the culture in the party. The problem with antisemitism runs deep. This is going to be the beginning of a very long journey. It’s all very well the Labour party saying sorry, and Keir Starmer did give an apology on the day he was elected. But what’s important here is that we see action. Words are only so much. We need to see that the action plan is implemented by 10 December and there need to be key changes across the party. We need an independent disciplinary process, education, and to tackle that culture. And this is going to be something that’s not going to change overnight. There’s a lot of pain and a lot of hurt. It’s not one person’s fault, but Jeremy Corbyn allowed the space for anti-Semites to come into the party and the leadership did absolutely nothing about it.
