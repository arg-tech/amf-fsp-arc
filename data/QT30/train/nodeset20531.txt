Fiona Bruce[0:53:20] Not a total thumbs up we're getting here. I'm sure there are some who support it, but it is interesting what we're hearing.
Grant Shapps[0:53:30] I had it with my own twins, doing their A-levels, and they weren't enamoured of the idea. But they are also desperate to get back to more structured learning. I think the question has come up because the education secretary being announced 7 million pounds of which 200 million is about how we can do catch-up, perhaps in certain years at key moments, some of which could be during the summer. There are other parts to that, tutoring programmes, mentoring programmes. It is part of a package to try to get the children who have lost out, probably more than any other single group during this crisis.
