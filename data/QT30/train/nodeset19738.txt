Fiona Bruce [00:04:58] In terms of the question, could we move faster? 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:05:02] The limitation was actually the vaccine delivery. So with Pfizer/BioNTech we had to hold back 50 percent until the regulator, the MHRA and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the chief medical officers said we could go to a 12-week interval between doses instead of the three-week interval. Now, this week, as of Monday, we got 530,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, and we have millions of doses that will come in the next weeks and months to come. The target we have been set is to do the first four cohorts by middle of February. So stretching target, an ambitious target because you are talking about 13 plus million people who will be the vaccine. Fiona Bruce [00:05:58] It is just under 14 million, isnâ€™t it? 13.9. Suzanne, you wanted back in. [DONE]
