Iona Bain[0:52:36] Well, I do agree that working from home is more civilised and enlightened where possible. But I think we should also bear in mind that actually, young people do need hands-on training, mentoring in the workplace and you can't bring on all your interpersonal skills through zoom. I am mentoring a young person in the financial industry at the moment and she is shy and she says it's really difficult for her to become more confident just by talking to her colleagues on-line. So I think that working from home has been a luxury that older people have been able to enjoy because they have had a lot of access to outdoor space perhaps, and they have had better facilities. But younger people have been cooped up typically in rented accommodation with flatmates they don't know that well. I think that's a change we have to maybe balance. But also in the future we are going to have to reassess how we spend our money. Perhaps prior to this we had a very buoyant consumer economy, and obviously we want that to come back, but at the same time, individuals are looking at what they spent their money on and they are asking, does this align with my values? Did I actually need to be buying that many clothes when I know what damage it does to the environment, for instance? There are certain things that I certainly do want to come back, because I don't want to keep seeing all my arts and culture on YouTube and zoom. We have to rescue the arts industry in the UK and we won't know what we have got till it's gone.
