AudienceMember 20211014QT47[0:52:40] We've got to change. Society has got to change. You mentioned Stephen Lawrence, which it is a very, very good example. That was like a template for reassessing racism, and Sarah Everard is the most revolting, disgusting thing that happened to a woman in a long time. But she is not the only one. We talk about her because it was a police officer who committed the crime, but what about - I can't think of her name off the top of my head.

AudienceMember 20211014QT48[0:53:14] There are so many women being killed by their partners every week and someone who has been accused of something like Prince Andrew and for someone of that elevation in terms of society, he needs to be held to account very, very seriously indeed.
Fiona Bruce[0:53:28] Well, I just want to reiterate again, when you say he needs to be held to account, he has not been found guilty of anything, he has been accused of things, that's as much as we can say. Minette, should he go to the States and face Virginia Giuffre?
