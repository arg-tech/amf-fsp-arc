Paul Mason[00:30:45] However, the point is that independence will be difficult, it will be difficult. Either Scotland will be part of the European Union and its currency or it will be part of basically a currency union with Britain that gives the Bank of England more or less economic control over Scotland. And the Scottish National Party knows this and it's so far been playing a kind of game. We want independence but not quite yet. So what happens there is that all the other important questions like poverty, inequality, dealing with the 21st century's technological revolution get sidelined because the electorate is rightly worried about being trapped in aâ€¦never mind neverendum, it's a never ending Tory elitist rule, and that's how it's perceived in Scotland. I became convinced covering that referendum in 2014 that the rising generation of young Scots allowed to be vote at 16, when they've got 16 year olds it's game over. I think we the English, the Welsh, probably have to accept that. And I know Lisa won't agree with me, but I wish my party, Labour, would begin to accept and prepare itself for the very exciting prospect of a socialist republic of Scotland.
