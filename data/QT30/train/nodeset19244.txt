FIONA BRUCE [01:00:24] David?
DAVID LAMMY [01:00:26] Well, I mean, it’s hard to follow that. 
FIONA BRUCE [01:00:28] It is. 
DAVID LAMMY [01:00:30] That was very moving to listen to. Look, I suspect, of course, there’s been progress over the last 25 years, but we’ve got a long way to go. Let me just say, I have three children. One of them has special educational needs and I know the struggle of parents in this country when they’re trying to get a statement. Of course there’s still huge discrimination in employment. I was thinking of the black student dragged out of the union, blind, just a year or so ago. I think there’s a lot to do in this country. We probably have to return to the legislation that’s required. If you look at that story of the 20th Century, it’s a lot of people at the beginning of that century, certainly the disabled, anyone with occasional needs, black and brown people, women, working people, all oppressed in some ways, put down, and by the end of the 20th Century beginning to get their rights. But we are still on that journey. As we go into a deep recession, we know that the people who can be deeply affected are those with disabilities. Let me just say, if you defund local authorities like we have in this country, if you have local authorities like Croydon or Northampton going bust, with big cuts of 50 percent, where is the money for adult social care that the disabled depend on? Where is the money for the kit and equipment that people need in their homes? All the money being cut in day centres right across the country. So it is not a rosy picture. In some ways it feels like a rolling back. I endorse what has been said.
