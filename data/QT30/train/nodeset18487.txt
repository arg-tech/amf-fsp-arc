Fiona Bruce [00:37:14] Bernadine?Bernadine Evaristo [00:37:15] Yeah, I don’t know, I don’t know what the solution is. So, if the hospitality industry does open up, as you would like Rocco, how do you keep people safe, you know? You can’t open up with social distancing, so how do you keep people safe?Rocco Forte [00:37:31] But I think it’s up to the consumer to decide what he wants to do. I mean people have been terrified by the government propaganda, and in a way that’s gradually breaking down already, you see it with the people on the beaches, you see it with people in the parks. They’re not social distancing and two metres, the only place I’ve seen it happening is here, tonight.Fiona Bruce [00:37:54] And we’re doing it very well. But, it’s not just propaganda, Rocco.Rocco Forte [00:37:57] [voices overlap 00:37:57] talking about the economy, it’s not about the economy, it’s about the livelihoods of millions of people. We’re not talking about thousands here, we’re talking about millions of people who are going to lose their jobs, and their families, and it’ll affect their health and everything else. You can’t just sweep it aside, oh it’s just the economy. What about the resorts in Wales, like Rhyl, Llandudno, Porthcawl, which depend entirely on a summer season? Those people are not going to be able to function. They’re not going to survive. They’ve had one winter, they’re going into another winter, and the summer which should have lifted them up, is not going to be there if you carry on like this. So all those businesses are going to be devastated [voices overlap 00:38:46] and all the jobs that go with them.
