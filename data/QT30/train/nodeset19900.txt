Fiona Bruce [00:29:54] James. 
[James]: Arlene, do you regret vetoing the two week extension just before Christmas that could have potentially saved more lives? 
Fiona Bruce [00:30:04] I was going to come to you Michelle. I’ll come to you first, Arlene. 
Arlene Foster [00:30:12] This has been an incredibly difficult time for everybody across Northern Ireland and I think we have been learning as we go in terms of how we deal with Covid-19. Of course, it has changed direction, changed course throughout all of this. As you know, in the Republic of Ireland they had a five-week very harsh lockdown before Christmas, then they found themselves in a worst position than we are at the moment. So, you know, you can look back with hindsight and say you should have done this or that but we’re dealing with a virus that changes direction, and what we took the decision on at that point in time was listening to the voices of the medical advice of course but also the voices of those people who had not been able to open up their coffee shops and hairdressers for four weeks. They were in dire straits. So we gave them an opportunity to open bear in mind the fact it made .05 difference to the R at that point in time. I believe we did take the right decision at that point in time.
