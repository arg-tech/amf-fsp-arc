Munira Wilson[0:43:31] And…no, but you went to the High Court, you got the injunction straightaway, and through the injunction you were able to take action.

The whole environmental debate needs reframing, not to focus on cost and compromise, but it needs to…we need to talk about jobs and opportunity. Now, with regards to the insulation elements, absolutely, you know, that is a clear thing that we can, must and should do, but I believe the government fully agree with that, and they'd like to insulate homes by 2035, but there's 20 million households in the UK, and it'll cost an average about a thousand pounds to do so per household, so that's a lot of dough. So what we need now is to see a proper well though through robust plan, in terms of how we're actually going to scale this up as quickly as possible.
