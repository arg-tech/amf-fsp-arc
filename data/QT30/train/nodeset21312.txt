[00:53:41] Kate, have you got any concerns about it?

Kate Forbes
[00:53:44] I can't wait to give people hugs. I'm a big fan of the side hug, which just is a recommendation, but otherwise…

Fiona Bruce
[00:53:50] You might have to talk us through that, what's a side hug?

Kate Forbes
[00:53:54] Oh, you know, where you cautiously sidle up to somebody you do know and you are familiar with and give them a side hug.

Fiona Bruce
[00:53:58] Hang on, Kate, Robert's giving us a demonstration.

Robert Buckland
[00:54:00] The side huge, yeah, the side hug, we're familiar with it, yeah, it's good.

Fiona Bruce
[54:06] So is that what you're going to…

Kate Forbes
[00:54:08] But I would just say, get involved and give people hugs.
