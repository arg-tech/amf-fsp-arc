Amanda King [00:38:52] Do you think the government was right to wait until the first day of school to announce school closures? 
[Speaker] I have to say we found the last few days around this issue of schools opening very frustrated. We were continually saying to government what is the evidence around this. I have to say as the Labour Party we really didn’t want to see schools closing. We still want schools to be the last places to close and the first to reopen. [DONE]
Fiona Bruce [00:39:24] You were calling for them to stay open on Monday morning then on Monday afternoon changed your mind. 
Anneliese Dodds [00:39:30] That wasn’t what happened. 
Fiona Bruce [00:39:34] The shadow education said they wanted the schools to stay open, then in the afternoon they wanted them closed. 
Anneliese Dodds [00:39:44] If at all possible. We still want them to stay open. With respect, I think we’ve entered a situation now where they have been closed because government says it is acting on that evidence, that it is necessary now, but we haven’t seen put into place the e-learning that’s necessary for those children so that they really can be receiving the kind of educational input they need. We’ve had so many months when this has been potentially on the cards. We had the first lockdown where there wasn’t that provision. It’s still not there. You know, now we’re saying to government, I suppose related to what Dave was saying before about looking forwards, we need to have a plan for when they’re going to be able to reopen. What will be the conditions so that we can get schools reopened? How are we going to deal with all these issues about digital devices and occasional disadvantage because this period has been really tough for so many families and we need a much stronger response from government than what we’ve seen so far.
