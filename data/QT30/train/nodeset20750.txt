Fiona Bruce[0:25:28] Right, let's move on. Alex Williams.
AudienceMember 20210318QT19[0:25:34] Prince William said today that the Royal Family is very much not a racist family. Do you agree?
Fiona Bruce[0:25:42] Steve.
Steve Reed[0:25:44] My overwhelming feeling listening to the interview with Oprah Winfrey and what's happened since is just a great sadness that this has happened to this family. I thought the statement the Palace put out a couple of days later struck exactly the right tone, when they said that there had been deeply concerning issues raised, that's for sure, but they wanted the space and privacy to deal with this as a family.
Fiona Bruce[0:26:20] Your colleague said the allegations of racism should be investigated. Do you think they should be investigated, as the allegations of bullying against Megan are?
Steve Reed[0:26:32] I think the institution of the monarchy is important for our country but they are people and they are a family and need the privacy to deal with it as a family. But I don't think we should glide over the serious issues that were raised.
Fiona Bruce[0:26:46] In terms of the question, the Royal Family is very much not a racist family, do you agree?
Steve Reed[0:26:52] I'm trying in a long way round --
Fiona Bruce[0:26:54] It is quite long. Do you want to answer that question, Steve?
Steve Reed[0:26:58] No, I don't. The Royal Family is a family comprised of people who are part of the society. There is racism in our society and it is deeply engrained.
