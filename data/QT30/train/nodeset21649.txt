Fiona Bruce[0:28:24] Andy, what does it mean to live with the virus? What will society look like?Andy Burnham[0:28:32] I want to start by saying that I like Javid.Fiona Bruce[0:28:38] He will be delighted to hear that. I'm sure he will be delighted with your endorsement.Andy Burnham[0:28:46] But in the last week he has sounded more like the Chancellor of the Exchequer than Health Secretary. He seems more concerned with the economy. I think he just needs to be a little careful about that. I say that in supporting the easing, as some of the Panel have said, you know, I'm not necessarily saying restrictions is the right way to go. We do need to move more to advice and let people manage their way through this and trust people to do that but I am worried, and I agree with Chika about this, I am worried about reports that distancing is going to be dropped and masks are going to be dropped. Now, I don't know if David was advocating both of those things.Fiona Bruce[0:29:26] You would like to keep all the distancing measures?Andy Burnham[0:29:28] You have to keep one or the other. You can't get rid of the distancing and the requirement to wear masks. You have to keep one of those. I was listening to Amanda. You have to think about people who will feel worried about being out there with people without masks. The tram in Manchester, you know, I know that if that goes, some people will feel very vulnerable if they were to use the tram. I think it is better to keep, I would say, the masks requirement.
