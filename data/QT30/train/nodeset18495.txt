Fiona Bruce [00:50:39] Let me get round the rest of the panel. Bernadine, what do you make of what you’re hearing?Bernadine Evaristo [00:50:43] I don’t know. I think there is a privacy issue, and I do think there’s a trust issue, actually I kind of agree with Ross, because I certainly haven’t taken my lead from this government, in terms of the pandemic. I went into lockdown some 10 days before the government told me to, because it was glaringly obvious to me that I should do, and I might have saved my life, I don’t know. Because I zap around London on the tube all the time. And the week before I went into lockdown, the tube was heaving, people were coughing and spluttering and sniffing, it was terrible. And I do know people who continued to travel around London, who got the virus, you know? So I did not take my leadership from this government. And we know about Boris and him shaking hands with coronavirus patients in a hospital, when we all knew that you shouldn’t be making physical contact with people.
