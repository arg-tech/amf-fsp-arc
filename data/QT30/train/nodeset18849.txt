Deborah Norrish[00:10:57] Good evening, everyone. Is a delay in learning of six months genuinely devastating to a whole generation, as was suggested by Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of…and the Chief Inspector of Schools?
Fiona Bruce[00:11:14] Jed – devastating for a whole generation?
Jed Mercurio[00:11:17] I think the problem with sending kids back to the school, and the delay, is something that we should all be concerned about. I think that the fact is that the time that children spend in school at a vulnerable age is precious time and I think it will be very very hard for them to catch up. So I think that definitely more should’ve been done in terms of planning. I think that there has been a failure of planning to get children back into school. I think that, obviously, the pandemic arrangements have put an enormous strain on the infrastructures in our society. But I also think that if you look at what is required for children to go back to school, it’s not just the fact that children need to go back to school, it’s that society needs those children back into school, because of all the things that surround children being in school – not requiring child care, and so forth. And I really wish that the government had gone about the planning in a more forthright and more detailed way.
