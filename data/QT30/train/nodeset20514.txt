Jeremy King[0:42:48] It is really interesting that we've had a proliferation around the world of what I call narcisstic denial, that if we shout loud enough that something didn't happen people will imagine it didn't. I feel the old saying that success has many parents and failure is an orphan is very prevalent at the moment. Before we move away from vaccinations one of the great successes, who everybody is taking the credit for is Kate Bingham. She didn't have any vaccines available, just like there was no PPE, but with amazing, amazing resilience she managed to make one of the great successes of this awful pandemic is the rollout of the vaccination programme and doesn't get the credit for it. I long for a time when people will admit their mistakes. We are all human. I'm just very disappointed that there was a denial.

Tony Danker[0:43:52] I'm going to be a very boring business person on this one. I think this might be a bit more boring --
Fiona Bruce[0:43:56] Please don't be boring.
Tony Danker[0:44:00] Now I've created the right expectations. I think what there wasn't was an oversupply of PPE which is what you need if everybody is going to be able to access it.
