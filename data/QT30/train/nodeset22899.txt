FIONA BRUCE [00:15:20] We have a question on that from John. Can the government confirm that that if and when the vaccine is proved it will be prescribed strictly upon clinical needs. 
MATT HANCOCK [00:15:34] Yes, that is is our proposal. We have a committee that is made up of clinicians and experts that advises me as health secretary in my formal capacity, the joint committee on vaccines and immunisations. This group looks at the data from a vaccine, and they have been working closely with Pfizer and AstraZeneca, and work out what is the best clinical way of protecting most people. They put out an interim recollection, which is that first we should vaccinate people who are in care homes and the people who work looking after them, and then health and social care workers, then come essentially down the age range. For all the different things like obesity that we know has an impact on your vulnerability to Covid, we know age is the single biggest factor by a long stretch. So the answer to your question, yes, we will vaccinate according to clinical priority because thatâ€™s how we save the most lives.[DONE]
