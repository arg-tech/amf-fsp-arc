Kate Forbes[00:36:20] And look, I don't expect everybody on the panel to agree with me on independence, that's clear. I don't expect everyone in Scotland to agree with me or even in the Question Time audience to agree with me. But that is precisely why that question needs to go back to the people. Now, we are not arguing that that should be next week, next month, we are arguing that once the COVID crisis is past, but in time to equip the parliament with the powers that we need to shape our future, there should be a referendum. Now, we live in parliamentary democracies. There can be no disputing the emphatic victory last week. And the only people who are saying no to another referendum are the people who are scared of the outcome. Debate the issues, debate the substance, don't just keep saying no to the people of Scotland, because that means that this union has fundamentally changed from one based on consent, a voluntary union based on consent, to one that is only based on the force of law.
