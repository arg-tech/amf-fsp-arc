Fiona Bruce [0:42:08] Why are they voting for this government?
Andy Burnham [0:42:12] I'm saying the left has failed to counter the narrative that has been built over the last decade. It has divided people and made them fearful of each other. What the Labour Party has to do, it can't bring people back together again and say there are policies that bind us all here. We all should be wanting a real living wage for everybody, wherever they come from, whatever community they are in. We should want, in my view, social care for everybody. Social policies coming out of the -- the place we should take population is the current England team. They --
Fiona Bruce[0:42:52] Every politician is trying to attach -- nail their colours to that particular mast.
Andy Burnham[0:42:58] It is a point because they have been attacked for taking the knee. This is the English working class, lads from all backgrounds, all colours. Actually, you know, the white members of the team have stood behind their teammates and they stood together. I actually take inspiration from them, the next generation in this country who I don't think see people in the same way. We need to take inspiration from that. Bring working class people back to get policies that help everybody. A real version of levelling up. The motto from the England team is if people stand together and fight together, they win together. That's what the left has to start doing and counter -- a decade where some of the wealthiest people around have started saying to working class people, blame your neighbour, who has a different coloured skin from you, for everything. We have to mount a better response to it.
