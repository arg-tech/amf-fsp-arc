FIONA BRUCE [00:55:30] You haven’t had a chance to answer the question about trying to get the vaccine through if we leave the EU without a deal.[DONE] 
MERRYN SOMERSET WEBB[00:55:38] I think I have to leave that one to Matt because I’m sure there are special arrangements for getting vaccines through very long lorry queues. But I really, really hope that the government has that organised. The wider question is presumably about Brexit and whether there will be long lorry queues in Dover if we go through on WTO terms. The answer to that is there probably will be very long queues in Dover, but there probably will be long lorry queues regardless of whether we have a deal or not because all change that involves lots of pieces of paper and admin and new organisation results in difficulties and holdups and blockages. But that will, I would guess, only last two or three months before we come out the other end. That will be unpleasant for those involved in it but if you believe Brexit is a good thing for the country for a long time, it will be a relatively small price to pay, I hope.[DONE]
