Nick Thomas-Symonds MP[0:06:12]No, no, that’s an unfair characterisation of what I said in the interview, with respect, Fiona. What I said was that the NEC were right to look at it again because of the decision that they'd made. They had to look at it again. They did look at it again, and then they made the right decision. But, look, I will speak about the fact that I raised the issue of antisemitism with members of the shadow cabinet. I wasn’t in the shadow cabinet. I also when I was out on the media said that more action had to be taken on antisemitism. Keir Starmer spoke in the shadow cabinet about it, he spoke out on the media about it. But the reality is this, we all have to accept today the failure of collective leadership. That is what that report makes absolutely clear. I’m not shying away from it, I accept every dot and comma of that report. What I would say today is over the period that I’ve been Shadow Home Secretary we are under this new leadership of Keir Starmer, we’ve made tackling antisemitism a very top priority. What I’ve always asked is to be judged on actions, not words. I see today as the start of that, and Keir Starmer showing this morning through that speech what we are now going to do and what we will now do to try and ensure that this scourge of antisemitism is driven out of our party and it is a safe and welcoming place, which is the Labour party that I want to see.
