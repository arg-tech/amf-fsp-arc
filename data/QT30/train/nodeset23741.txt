I completely agree with the right to protest and protecting those very sacred rights, but this isn't normal protest, this is just absolute destruction and chaos, and it is jeopardising people's lives in the back of ambulances. It's putting people in a terrible situation. 

And I think David hit the nail on the head when he said it's about swaying hearts and minds. We're in a great position in the UK where if you look at the major parties, you might not like all their policies by any means, but their voting base is in agreement that we want to make this a greener world, that we want to tackle climate change, but you're not winning people over and you're not helping the cause when you just ruin someone's day or actually put somebody in danger. So this needs to be cracked down on and quite quickly.

[0:42:01] Let me be very clear, they have gone about campaigning on climate change in absolutely the wrong way, and are putting the cause back by the danger that they are creating, causing.

Fiona Bruce
[0:42:15] I mean, they might argue at least we're talking about it.

Munira Wilson
[0:42:17] Sorry?

Fiona Bruce
[0:42:18] They might argue that at least we're talking about it.
