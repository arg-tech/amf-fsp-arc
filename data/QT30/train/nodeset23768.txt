[0:22:50] The Government should touch up the cash and put in a system to get as much of that money back as possible from the people responsible. Leaseholders need to know they are protected. They can't afford to pay the bills. They are stuck in death trap flats. Some are facing bankruptcy and homeless. Some of them who are not bankrupt yet may invalidate their legal qualifications and ruin their careers. This is a national scandal. The Government has had ten months to come up with a solution. They have refused to do so!

[0:23:22] I agree. This really is a scandal. Grenfell was in 2017 and it was a man-made disaster! And, as well as the people directly involved in it, it has also had a terrible lot of repercussions for others. People have found themselves not just living in unsafe accommodation but as a result financially stuck, unable to move out, unable to do anything facing extraordinary costs. What the Government has thus far offered has been a mixture of grants and loans and some of them preceding very slowly isn't enough to meet that. The Government has, I'm afraid I agree in the first instance it's gots to cough up the cash, as the Lib Dems say it then needs to claw it back from the private contractors who in most cases are the people responsible for this scandal.
