[0:04:10] We don't have many details and it will probably be a while until we get them, but from -- it's obviously a failure of diplomacy. It is a terrible tragedy that we're not getting on well at all with our next door neighbours and we've already had to bring the dogs out to face each other off.

[0:04:36] The French are not very proportionate either. They were talking about cutting power off. That's not diplomatic either. We do need to learn to talk. I think that's been the biggest problem with Brexit as well. We clash too much. We've got to learn to start talking to our neighbours again. We have to get on with them.

[0:05:04] Turn the question around. What on Earth gave the French the right to suddenly start blockading a British port? The only mistake the Royal Navy made was not sinking the ships in the first place. It is a disgusting thing to have done. To try to justify it by saying we should have been diplomatic, where were they? .

[0:05:34] There was an agreement agreed at the last minute. In that Trade and Cooperation Agreement there were problems predictable and predicted. For a start, the protocol on Northern Ireland, that there would be a border down the Irish Sea was entirely predictable and predicted. The fishing problem was also a predictable and predicted problem. While I dividend defending the jobs, I would like to put effort into the 2 million jobs from the creative industries that have been harmed by this.
