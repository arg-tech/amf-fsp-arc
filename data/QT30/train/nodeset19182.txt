Chris Philp MP[0:45:18] Well, I don’t have a crystal ball, and it would be I think rash and foolish to make firm predictions about what’s going to happen in the future. What I can say is that right now, today, looking at the regional differences, looking at the costs that a full lockdown would impose on people’s health, mental health, children’s education, health treatment, jobs and so on, the balance being struck is the right one. And, as I say, the World Health Organisation agree with that. But it is of course kept under review the whole time, which is a sensible thing to do.Fiona Bruce[0:45:45] Donna, you’re shaking your head there. And I know because I spoke to some of you in the audience before we came on air, you’ve been shielding with your husband for eight months now haven’t you?
