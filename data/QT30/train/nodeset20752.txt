Steve Reed[0:11:56] I have been struck today from women I've talked to or commenting on social media how widespread this sense of fear is and how many women have experienced abuse or harassment on the streets.
Fiona Bruce[0:12:08] Were you surprised by that?
Steve Reed[0:12:12] The extent of it, I was surprised by it. I think every woman has the right to feel safe walking around the street of this country any time whatsoever. What happened today and the fear that women feel is not the fault of women, it is the fault of men who have allowed women to feel this way.
Fiona Bruce[0:12:30] What can be done about that? I remember going on Reclaim the Night marches when I was at university. They have been going since the '70s. What can be done about it?
Steve Reed[0:12:40] It is incumbent on men to reflect how we act. We have to call out attitudes abusive towards women when we see it. We have to become allies of women much more.
