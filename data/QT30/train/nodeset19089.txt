[00:29:40] I’m going to -- with the same point again, there’s a huge big challenging problem out there and, frankly, we’re talking about not unimportant issues but not primary issues. I think there’s a breakthrough appeared with the three-tier approach. Clearly, the country is being affected in different ways. It is absolutely right that some parts of the country should be subject to different rules and regulations than others. So the three-tier approach is a good approach and should be -- definitely should be pursued with great care taken as to what the lockdown issues are and how they might be applied. In terms of hospitality, I’ve got three sons, two of which are heavily involved in pubs and restaurants and bars, so I follow that quite carefully. One thing you must remember, there’s a huge number of young people employed and one of the biggest concerns I have is we’re going to finish up with a lot of young people unemployed. So I really hope we can do something significant with hospitality and try to prevent who could be very significant unemployment in that area.
