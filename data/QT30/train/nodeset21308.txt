Fiona Bruce[00:40:57] Okay. We were just responding to what Andi was saying, which was basically can we have a bit more peace and love in the room and, Andi, everyone's hearing that, so let's see how we get with the next question, which is from Molly. Molly, let's hear from you.
Molly Unknown[00:41:08] Thanks, Fiona. Will voter IDs protect the integrity of elections or just undermine the UK democracy?
Fiona Bruce[00:41:17] Paul, kick us off with this.
Paul Mason[00:41:18] Well, do you know how many people were convicted of voter fraud in the 2019 election? I think it's out of 32 million people who voted. Anybody know? Four, four. And two of them were for registering wrong, criminally, they were convicted. I think the number of complaints was 136. So voter ID is not there to solve a problem that we the people see. And the people who've admitted this are the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission say our system is straight in this country. People worry about media bias, they worry about low turnout, but they don't worry in general about this.
