Fiona Bruce[0:26:10] Anneliese, what is Labour's position?
Anneliese Dodds[0:26:12] This is not a simple issue. That has been summed up in what Jeremy said. I think there are risks in all different directions around this. Obviously, there are major practicalities. There are those ethical issues as well and equality issues. I have to say, personally, to me the most important thing, that is obscured a bit about this debate, is about the speed of vaccination.
Fiona Bruce[0:26:36] That isn't the question. The question is should there be a vaccine passport to allow businesses to ensure COVID safety when entering indoor venues? Do you have a position on that?
Anneliese Dodds[0:26:48] If we don't see people being vaccinated at speed, then it will be very unfair because the young people we just mentioned wouldn't be able to have that. We have said, for example, we would have wanted the vaccination to go much more quickly so we could have had vaccinated over the half term. We did state that. We believe there could have been capacity to deliver that. There are examples of different facilities that said they could have been involved in that vaccination effort.
