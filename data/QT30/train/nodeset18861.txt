Lisa Nandy [00:25:27] One of the real outstanding problems with all of this at the moment is that you’ve got public health directors across England saying that they still don’t get…the GPs in local areas don’t get the results of tests. Because the government set up their own private sector testing facilities around the country, so GPs just simply don’t know whether their patients are testing positive for COVID. Public health directors are looking closely at local outbreaks and having to make decisions about managing local outbreaks, but because they’re not getting that information, they just simply don’t have the tools that they need to do the job. So, we need a reset here. It’s right for the government to abandon a system if it isn’t working, but we need to ask ourselves, why is it so often that we end up having to unravel plans over and over again because we didn’t get them right in the first place?Fiona Bruce[00:27:20] Yeah, and, Steve, I wanted to ask you not only what you think about this particular question but also just tell us a little bit about how you’re managing at Crystal Palace, because you’ve got a kind of app of your own there, haven’t you?
