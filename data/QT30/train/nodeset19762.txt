Humphrey Cobbold [00:50:24] My heart goes out to James and the many other hundreds of thousands of operators of smaller businesses in the UK. It is tough as a large business operator as well, but people pushing forward on their own like that, I think it is a tremendous contribution. I would echo James’ views. It is always difficult when somebody gives you something, and the chancellor gave something out this week, to not be grateful for it. We are grateful for it, every little helps. But it really is not in line with the promise he made to do whatever it takes to support businesses. Tremendously tough for businesses like ours who have had to close down and take pain, like James’, on behalf of society as a whole. What I’m arguing for, and I’m sure James would as well, for a proportionate support. I run a large chain of budget gyms in that arena we had to close, by end of February, it will be 30 weeks out of the prior 50. James will have been in a similar position. Badly-impacted businesses require more targeted support. I think Annaliese has been vocal about this as well. It is a really important area. We want to work with government on behalf of our own business but many other actions like James’ out there. I know it is not easy for the chancellor or the government. Credit to them, they put a lot of effort into this. I think there’s much more we can do. Otherwise, otherwise, what we will face is an economic long number of businesses that are struggling to stay afloat for a long period of time. We won’t be able to reflate the economy and build the economy back. It is going to be so important to provide the services we want and the jobs in the future that we all want in the future from this.
