Angela Haggerty[0:18:47] Because people in Scotland are not simply just going to say oh well, we voted for it but they said no, so let's move on. Of course they're not. They're going to get angry about the fact that they are being denied the thing they voted for. I think we would be getting into very, very dangerous territory if Westminster tries to continue to block this. It looks like the SNP is going to win a majority. The polls in favour of independence are rising consistently. Westminster can't keep ignoring this. It has to be addressed.
Fiona Bruce[0:19:20] Sharon.
Audience Member[0:19:22] So Scottish trade to the UK accounts for 60 percent of exports compared with 19 percent to the UK --
Fiona Bruce[0:19:34] To the EU, I think you mean.
Audience Member[0:19:36] I don't think it is responsible for Scotland to try to be leaving the UK right now and attempting to join the EU. It can't be considered economically justifiable, let alone before peak COVID. And the situation is even worse now.
Fiona Bruce[0:19:58] Jason?
Audience Member[0:20:00] I would like to point out to people and try to remind them that the SNP is not the only pro-independence party in Scotland. There is the green-party.
Audience Member[0:20:10] Yes, the SNP could quite conceivably not gain a majority but there could be a majority vote for pro-independence parties overall if you take into account the green vote.
