Fiona Bruce [00:27:42] Annaliese, they only called for full lockdown a few days ago. 
Anneliese Dodds [00:27:50] This relates to what Mark said. This claim that somehow you can trade off the economy against public health, I’m afraid we’ve seen in spades in this country that simply doesn’t work. When people don’t have confidence that they are going to be safe, then they’re not actually going out and consuming. They’re not going out working. And having this extremely heavy death toll and this very severe impact that we’re seeing now has an enormous human cost but it has a human cost as well. The mental health impact is huge on the workforce. That won’t finish with the lockdown ends, that will continue for a very long time. In terms of the latest lockdown, yes, we did call for a full lockdown before the government announced it, but before Christmas, I have to say, we were very concerned about the situation then. I think we’re probably seeing, sadly, because of the lag in this disease then coming through into hospitals, we’re seeing some of the impact of what happened around that time and we said repeatedly to government then: Please, review the evidence around this situation. It is my understanding that the health secretary was talking about the new strain in part on 14 December, actually. The Prime Minister was informed about it on 18 December. We didn’t have a change in policy for a very, very long time. We can’t have this what feels like a constant lag between evidence coming through and then action.
