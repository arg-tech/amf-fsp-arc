Fiona Bruce[0:14:06] Emily Thornberry.
Emily Thornberry[0:14:10] There is an appeal process. Let me touch on that for a minute. What happens is if a complaint has been made against you, let's say you received half a million pounds for two companies to lobby for them, let's say, as happened with this case, and he goes before an independent commissioner, he then can go before a panel of MPs then can go before the whole of Parliament. It is important to stick to the truth. What happened 25 years ago, obviously, was at the end of a long time of tory government conservatory MPs were taking money in brown envelopes to ask questions on behalf of companies, at the end of this long period of a conservative government we havetory MPs taking money again to ask questions and lobby on behalf. At least last time they were ashamed. It is not just conservatives, there have been other MPs, clearly, who have brought Parliament into disrepute and we need to have an independent system that can assess what has happened and make sure proper decisions are made. We cannot have MPs deciding for themselves.
