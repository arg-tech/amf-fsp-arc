[ANTHONY COSTELLO] : No, you do have protection and you are protected against dying. You are not necessarily -- we have to state the facts, and this is the government figures released today, about the transmissibility and also about the -- the additional vaccines. We have to face reality. I'm not arguing for another national lockdown. I wish we had not had lockdowns and followed a much more oppressive policy. I would be going much more for a locally-led process. So hotspots can be closed down quickly. 
[JENNI MURRAY] : I'm sure you're right and very well informed but I'm in a position where, you know, we heard of so many lives that have been told in the last, is it 18 months, 15 months, however long it has been, we don't know who to trust. 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Let's see what our audience make of that. Andrea. 
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : I'm just empathising massively with Jenni. Hi, everyone. I study micro biology in university. But that was about a million years ago. My comment on the coronavirus is why are we not making some kind of plan to encourage people to conform to the guides, the rules, the regulations that are there? We know wearing a mask works. Let's make that mandatory. Let's make it an offence not to wear a mask. What's happening with that?
