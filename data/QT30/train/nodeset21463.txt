[FIONA BRUCE] : Is now the time, Heather? [HEATHER MCGREGOR] : Just a point of clarification. There hasn't been a ban on evictions. Evictions have been possible throughout the pandemic; it is the length of notice period that has been given. What has changed this week in England only -- [FIONA BRUCE] : Hang on. Evictions -- I'm sorry, evictions were not being enforced unless in very particular circumstances, which effectively was a ban. Do you think the time has come to lift that ban now? [HEATHER MCGREGOR] : I do. In order to have a properly functioning rental sector. Can I say why we need a properly functioning rental sector. It is because house prices have gone up so much now that it is almost impossible for anybody to get on the housing ladder in an early stage.
