AudienceMember 20210902QT32[0:39:30] (26) To what mental health service would you ask them to go to? Our mental health service is shocking. Absolutely shocking. [Applause].
James Cleverly[0:39:40] No, we have, we have, there are - there is a very strong network particularly of military mental health charities, and ...
AudienceMember 20210902QT33[0:39:50] (27) Charities, James!
James Cleverly[0:39:52] And they -- they work closely with mental health services in the NHS.

Rory Stewart[0:40:04] In the middle of this debate is a real natural political black and white thing. There are people like Mehdi saying the whole thing was doomed from the start, it was a total catastrophe, no good came out of it. Obviously, there were people in 2017, 2008 ...
Mehdi Hasan[0:40:16] Stop putting words in my mouth.
Rory Stewart[0:40:20] People saying in 2008, the whole thing was terrifically successful, we would build a Switzerland in central Asia.

It was a ghost town. 300,000 people, nobody in the streets, 4 million refugees. We built a charity in 2006. I've got 400 employees on the ground at the moment. They are at risk from the Taliban because of an entirely unnecessary and reckless decision by Biden trying to emulate President Trump. We didn't need to do it, and what we've done is we've destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives.
