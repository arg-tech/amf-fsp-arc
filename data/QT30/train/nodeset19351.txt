Fiona Bruce [00:53:26] I’m going to go around quickly but I thought it was an important question. Liam. 
Liam Halligan [00:53:32] I have two school age children, one at university. But just as a citizen not just a dad my heart breaks for people. That’s why I wanted to see more age stratified lockdown. Older lecturers, older teachers who are vulnerable, who have pre-exiting conditions, they can supported financially while shielding, but we have been far too quick to close down schools and, for the most part, universities. It really for me sticks in the craw. I would like to see universities refunding students part of these fees they’re paying particularly, as we’ve heard, students from lower socio-economic groups. 
Fiona Bruce [00:54:10] Peter?
Peter Openshaw [00:54:12] I think it has been an incredibly tough year not only for students but also for staff. You know, my colleagues at Imperial have been working day and night to try to make it safe to teach. Many universities have succeeded really well. There have been very few in-class transmissions of the virus and there has been quite a lot of transmission, but that’s mostly due to students being social, which is what they come to university for. I think it is patchy, but I do want to acknowledge the huge effort that has been put in by many people at universities and by hugely dedicated people who are trying to deliver teaching under very difficult circumstances.
