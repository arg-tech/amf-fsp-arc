Fiona Bruce[0:00:48] The first question is from James alcock.
Audience Member A[0:00:58] Why can you sit on a beverage on 8 March for a drink with a friend but you have to wait 35 days later to do it outside a licensed pub or restaurant? Social contact is no different. If anything, it's safer. Why are we waiting.
Fiona Bruce[0:01:16] What's your feeling about this?
Audience Member B[0:01:24] The social contact is no different. As much as I believe the British public want to do the right thing, the reality is, as an operator, I'll manage that for you, I'll make sure you're safe, that's what we do, we're experts in safety. If the guidelines are there to make sure people are 1.5, 2 metres apart, I'll do that for you. To make people manage that themselves, it is difficult.
