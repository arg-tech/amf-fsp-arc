Tom Kerridge [00:32:32] The students aren’t to blame, it is the movement of people. 
Fiona Bruce [00:32:36] Peter, do you want to pitch in here since you are the man looking at this evidence as a scientist. [DONE]

If you have a quiet environment with well ventilated areas, where you can have social ventilation, and there are well-managed places you can have a meal and drink a pint at the same time where the transmission rate is very, very low. But loud music and shouting in a close environment is per for the transmission of the virus. 
Fiona Bruce [00:33:28] If there was a pub that wasn’t playing music would you be happy to go there. 
Peter Openshaw [00:33:32] I would be comfortable to go into a pub that was quiet, well-ventilated and you could keep your distance from people.
