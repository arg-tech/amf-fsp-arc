[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : A landlord should have the right to use his property and let whoever he wants in there to rent. However, I do think the government should come up with an incentive scheme to pay landlords who support poor tenants or people who struggle with their rent, that the government steps in and actually helps the landlord and encourages them to try to keep the tenant going. Also, I do think the tenants should have that wee bit more support as well until we get well and truly out of this COVID pandemic. 
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Whilst I have every sympathy with landlords, the ending of the eviction ban is premature. Michael Gove said he doesn't rule out an extension to furlough. That means more people losing their jobs or not earning as much, not able to pay their rent. So now is not the time.
