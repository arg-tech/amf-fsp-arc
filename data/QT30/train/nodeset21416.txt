Fiona Bruce[00:52:28] Charlie.
Charlie Unknown[00:52:31] Thanks. Yes. I mean, obviously, yes, we should do more, however I'm not really sure what we should be doing, apart from engaging. It's so tricky. But if we can try and get to a situation where we start without blaming people or either side for stuff that was done in the past and let's just say, right, where do we want to get to and how do we get there, rather than bringing back references to things that have gone wrong in the past.

Richard Unknown[00:53:02] Thank you, Fiona. Yeah, I agree with Charlie there. Do we actually know what the two sides want here? And ultimately I'm not too sure that we can ever arrive at a solution where the two sides can work together. The best I think we can hope for is that each side works in their own little worlds under their own little cultures and if there is any interaction between the two it's on some kind of guidelines that maybe we could produce something for. But to try and get some kind of coming togetherness, this is too deep rooted for that in my opinion, and really it's a case of let's live in our own communities and take it from there.
