Fiona Bruce[0:56:56]Paul, you asked the question. Do you want to have the last word on that?Male Aud 7[0:57:00]Yeah, thank you, Fiona. Yes. I lost my father and my wife both to longstanding health issues in 2019.Fiona Bruce[0:57:10]Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that.Male Aud 7[0:57:12]And I actually feel fortunate that they died last year because we were able to give them a dignified and fitting funeral. The families of almost 46,000 COVID victims, which you’re broadcasting from Lincoln, is half the population of Lincoln… Go onto Lincoln High Street whenever, every other person you see, that is the level that people are dying. Any delay to a second national lockdown only risks the similar number of families suffering this heartache where you can’t be at your loved one’s bedside when they take that last breath, you can’t even give them a fitting and dignified send off. It is appalling, and it needs to happen now, tonight, from half past ten, half past 11. Not three weeks in the future. It needs to happen now.Fiona Bruce[0:58:15]Well, you’ve made your point, Paul. And I’m so sorry for your loss last year. Thank you very much for that.
