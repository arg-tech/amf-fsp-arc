[PETER KYLE] : So I just ask people to be kind when we have situations like this. It is a genuine human thing to do. I'm sure that the sport, like every other profession, can identify individual people based on individual discussions and informative exchanges to people who just need to quietly be let off the hook on one or two things. We can't we do that in a sport with the resources that tennis has.

[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Thank you, Fiona. I'm sure when we make these life choices and sport is one of them, surely publicity and the press comes with the territory. I feel very sorry for Naomi but she should have anticipated that people would be interested in her story. She would be interviewed. I bet, Jenni, if she had had the opportunity on the day she would have had her on women's hour.
