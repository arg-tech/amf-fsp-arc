Fiona Bruce[0:55:57]But, Nick, just before you we heard Billy there who's a doctor saying that once you get to a certain level of numbers of cases test and trace becomes less effective and easily becomes overwhelmed, and in Wales where there's a greater success with test and trace nonetheless cases are going up.Nick Thomas-Symonds MP[0:56:12]Well, yes, cases are on the rise, and that's why we've taken the measure that we have. Now, that measure came into place last Friday. It will be for 17 days. And obviously we will then as we come out of it see what the impact of that has been. But I think taking the diligent, cautious approach that has defined the approach to the virus under the leadership of Mark Drakeford here in Wales has been the way to approach it. And the reality is that with the tiered system in England I'm afraid it's just not the case that areas are permanently coming out of the restrictions or permanently coming out of the tiers, the figures are very sadly going in one direction. And I want to see the government in England getting on top of the virus in the way that we're attempting to do so here in Wales.
