Fiona Bruce[0:50:58] Man over there.
AudienceMember 20210930QT35[0:50:59] I think the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, 56 per cent just betrays a complete misunderstanding of what the patients of his members want. They might not want 100 per cent face to face, but I'm pretty sure that it's a damn sight more than 56. If he thinks that 56 is about right, then he's very wrong.
Fiona Bruce[0:51:22] So Grant, NHS England changed their guidance in May, which had been the COVID guidance, so that it was kind of triage system, so you didn't get…so a lot of appointments were remote. That was changed, but then actually GPs just carried on doing it remotely anyway.
Grant Shapps[0:51:35] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I look, I entirely agree with the question and actually other panel members, people should have the ability to go and see their GP. There are many times where you might present with one issue, but a GP who's skilled will know that there may be some other underlying issue or ask you a question that leads you to go for a further check-up or whatever it is, so people should absolutely have that right ability…
Fiona Bruce[0:51:57] So when you've got the Royal College of GPs saying it's just undeliverable to be able to have face to face appointments.
