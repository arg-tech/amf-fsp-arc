Jo Grady[0:28:04] I have two reservations. As a customer, you might think it is fine. I have two reservations. One is about workers, the extent to whether workers will be compelled, coerced, to have a vaccine when they don't want to. But my primary concern, and I worry this has happened a lot during the pandemic, is we're always looking for a quick solution, for a shortcut, for the next fix, when what we need to do is get on top of the virus, as close to a zero state as possible. So I have lots of empathy with business owners who would like this to enable their customers to feel safe, but there's a sting in the tail for workers here, particularly in terms of hospitality and getting people back in.
Fiona Bruce[0:28:52] Bethany. What would you like to say?
Audience Member 8[0:28:56] I work in healthcare and I encourage every patient I meet to get their COVID vaccine, but the idea of a passport is ethically unacceptable. You you cannot have two tiers of society, one group who can go out and enjoy themselves, the others who have to stay inside. I think the moral dilemma that creates is awful.
