Fiona Bruce [0:33:29] David.
Male Aud 3 [0:33:29] Can I ask all the panel what they think will happen in the United States if Mr Trump is re-elected? Will they remain United?
Fiona Bruce [0:33:39] All right. We’ll come to that in a moment. William, you had your hand up.
Male Aud 4 [0:33:44] Trump’s very divisive in what he does. He’s looking after number one I think. But unfortunately there’s millions of votes for him, so it might be closer than you think next week.
Fiona Bruce [0:33:55] Marie, the question from Helen was should people in the UK be concerned, and Donald Trump is behind in the polls, steadily behind at the moment, but who knows what could happen. Are you concerned?
Marie van der Zyl [0:34:08] I definitely think I’m concerned, because whatever happens in the US is going to impact right round the world. In terms of the Jewish community, a recent poll from the American Jewish Committee said that 75 per cent of Jews would vote Democrat, and certainly Trump has been a very divisive figure. Personally for me he hasn’t disavowed himself of his associations with the right wing or white supremacists. But in terms of foreign policy he has done some good things. With the Middle East, for example, he has helped to normalise relations with Israel and Dubai and other countries…
Fiona Bruce [0:34:55] The UAE and Bahrain.
Marie van der Zyl [0:34:56] With the UAE and Bahrain recently.
Bonnie Greer [0:34:57] [No doubt 0:34:56] the Palestinians.
Marie van der Zyl [0:34:59] And of course we’ve got Brexit, which hasn’t yet been mentioned on this programme.
Fiona Bruce [0:35:03] It’s very…yeah. It doesn’t happen as often as it used to.
Bonnie Greer [0:35:04] I’m about to. I’m about to.
