Andrew RT Davies[00:21:01] Can I just bring the point in though, which is really important as well, Europe aren't helping themselves when you've got the comments of President Macron and Angela Merkel, ultimately the AstraZeneca vaccine is a good solid vaccine that will help us in the fight against this COVID crisis, and sometimes they just need to look in the mirror at some of the points they've been making. Fiona Bruce[00:21:21] Alison.Alison Unknown[00:21:23] I think we should vaccinate everyone in this country before we start exporting it. I think the fact that we were organised and got our orders in earlier than everyone else, I think that's a big flag wave for us and I think there's a lot of bitterness in Europe because, well, we've left now and anything now that they can do to fire at us or to try and paint us in any sort of bad light or anything, they're trying to do, and I think this vaccination scenario now is an ideal opportunity for them.
