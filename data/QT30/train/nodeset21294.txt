Michelle Dewberry[00:35:00] However, the two caveats I would make to that is that it's been seven years since the last referendum and I still don't understand even an ounce of what Scotland's economic policies and plans would be. For example, how on earth you think you would fund this deficit as an independent country is beyond me, and the EU are going to be in a very tricky position, because the EU can't be seen to encourage Scotland to leave and rejoin…and by the way, we're assuming Scotland can rejoin the EU. They might not even meet the criteria. Scotland cannot be seen to be overly encouraging this, because if they do they're going to have it in the neck from the countries that are within the EU at the moment who have challenging separatist movements that the EU need to not be stoking. So it's a very interesting point. But I really…my final thing is I don't share all of this enthusiasm about how amazingly well the SNP did at the last election, by the way, because they only gained one seat and they've only got a majority by teaming essentially with the Greens.
