AudienceMember 20211111QT02[0:16:20] I think, actually, it is a bit disingenuous to say he didn't have the right of appeal. He was able to take his lawyers in to speak to the committee. He had 17 written witnesses that he could stake --Fiona Bruce[0:16:36] Written statements you mean.AudienceMember 20211111QT03[0:16:38] Written statements that that he could take. They were about character. I read the report yesterday. They were character references. It is like having more witnesses who will say, yes, he might be a burglar but while he was burgling your house he fed the cat. He's a nice man therefore it doesn't count. That's not true. I think the British public are fed up thinking Boris Johnson thinks he can get his mates after. My narrative for this story is that Boris Johnson flew in a private jet down to London, we object to a party, went to meet his friends. Amongst his friends were people there who persuaded him to get him off, to get Owen Paterson off. He said "I'll do this". It might not be the true but that's what it is in the general public's mind. I'm telling you lots of people are saying that. My friends are saying that. We don't understand what happened yesterday. At one point he was saying we should do this, by lunchtime today, everything is thrown up in the air and everything is changed. What's the truth of it? Where are the facts in this?
