[00:51:00] So, you know, young people are much more intelligent than we give them credit, there are good decent young people out there, and I'm glad to hear that they have the opportunity now to play a part in what is the future is then the young people themselves.

[00:51:16] We've got time to squeeze one more question in from Sarah Wingfield. Sarah? 

Sarah Unknown
[00:51:20] Hello, thank you, Fiona. There's a new proposal to mandate the flying of the Union Jack on all government buildings across the United Kingdom daily, excluding Northern Ireland. Is this likely to unite the nations as presumably intended, or might our flags become politicised? 

Fiona Bruce
[00:51:40] Is this a good idea, Andrew? 

Andrew RT Davies
[00:51:41] I think it is, but I think in Wales obviously we have our own flag and we fly that with the Union flag because we're part of the United Kingdom, an important part of the United Kingdom.
