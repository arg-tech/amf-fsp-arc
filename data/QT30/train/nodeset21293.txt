[00:12:10] Starmer saying stuff like Black Lives Matter was just a moment, it's not, it's the social justice that the Labour Party was founded on and I could be proud to vote for and I don't feel the same way anymore.

[00:12:31] Martin?

Martin Unknown
[00:12:33] Thank you. We need the Labour Party to be better. The country needs a strong opposition that actually people like me will vote for. I voted for all parties in my lifetime and I want there to be a Labour Party that is good and it provides hope and inspiration for people. But it isn't at the moment. You're fighting between yourselves. You appear to be a London-centric party that isn't reaching out across the country, so you need to do something.

[00:13:11] Tony.

Tony Unknown
[00:13:12] Yes, thank you, Fiona, and good evening. I don't need to be lectured on somebody from south London about politics in the north-east of England. I lived in Hartlepool, I now live in Durham. Durham was a Labour stronghold for 100 years and now it's lost its majority. Out of 126 county councillors only 53 are now Labour. And I'll tell you why that happened, it's because the Labour Party in Durham just didn't listen to what people were saying.
