Audience Member 11[0:30:32] It already exists in a way. I'm lucky to have had my first vaccination. When you get the vaccination you get a little card with the details of the date and time of the vaccination. Now, assuming that my situation is not unique, then it probably means that the majority of people have already had such a document. Now, business owners can decide at their own whim whether or not to serve people. If they choose to take action if you can't show proof you had a vaccination, they are entitled to do that. So the point is, really, a vaccines passport almost existed all right.
Fiona Bruce[0:31:16] Tony, what's the view of the CBI on this?
Tony Danker[0:31:20] I asked about 200 businesses about this this week. This is what I have learned. It could just be for vaccination, it should also include testing. I think that will take care of some of the timing thing. I agree with Jeremy, I don't think it is quite the coercion issue, because we are talking about voluntary activities. It shouldn't be true for compulsory activities.
