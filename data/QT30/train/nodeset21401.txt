Richard Walker[00:40:06] No. Increasingly we're becoming British in our sourcing decisions, we're British chicken, British beef, because that's what customers want, and that's me and all of our competitors as well. I think it's maybe a bit of a false dichotomy, this, because there's a quota on New Zealand lamb at the moment which has never once been hit, and I think that's driven by the customer, but also it's driven by simple economics. If you're an Australian beef farmer then you're probably best following the money and selling it to your next door neighbour, China, and unfortunately their burgeoning demand for meat as opposed to a rainy, windswept island in the North Atlantic.
Fiona Bruce[00:40:51] Australia's biggest beef export is saying that exports in the UK could increase possibly up to ten fold if a deal like this is done.
Richard Walker[00:40:59] I don't see that from my perspective. I don't think customers want it, and I can't see that happening.
