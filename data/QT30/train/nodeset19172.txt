Chris Philp MP[0:44:21]The World Health Organisation, and indeed the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Van-Tam, have both said the regional approach makes sense. We have to balance the profound impact that a hard lockdown would have on children’s education, on mental health, on people seeking, for example, cancer treatment, on jobs. We have to balance those considerations against the health consideration and try and get it right. Respect the fact, understand the fact that things are working differently in different parts of the country. So that is why this careful balance, very well calibrated balanced approach has been taken. Now, clearly that will be kept under review and if the facts change a different decision may be taken in the future. But it’s the right approach.Fiona Bruce[0:45:00]Seriously, Chris, I’m just listening to you go through that, and I’ve got no crystal ball and I have no medical knowledge, but just watching the graphs, watching that cases are increasing everywhere, are you going to end up coming back here in two weeks, three weeks and saying we’ve watched the facts, they’ve changed now, we’re going for a lockdown?
