FIONA BRUCE [00:45:08] Hold on. Donna, I know there was something you wanted to add to this particular subject as. DONNA UNKNOWN [00:45:18] Yes, absolutely. On 1 January 2021, will Dover become a well-oiled gateway to Europe or the biggest car park in the UK? FIONA BRUCE [00:45:30] It all plays into the same thing, A, what is going to happen the end of December, but in terms of us getting the vaccine and getting it through Customs is that going to be a problem? Is this something you thought about, Robin? Is this a concern for you?[DONE] ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:45:46] I haven’t thought about this in terms of what the immediate priority is. But we certainly realise in the UK, particularly as we go through Brexit, that we need to really ramp up UK manufacturing capacity so that we can make vaccines. And we have cutting-edge technology in this country. I think one of the things that we recognise is that from a pragmatic point of view, we have made -- the government has made purchase of six vaccines, five of those are from overseas. That’s increasing our reliance on overseas production.[DONE]
