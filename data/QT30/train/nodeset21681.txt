Madeline Grant[0:32:28] I think the reporting needs to change. Right now people are being read out figures that sound scary in and of themselves. You hear about the number of deaths per day or the number of infections, but without the true context and without, for example, knowing where those infections are taking place, if they are taking place in people at minimal risk of infection or complications, that is a difficult proposition. But without that context it adds to the sense of pessimism and fear. Until we get past that, I don't think we are going to be at the old normal again.Andy Burnham[0:33:04] The trouble with what you're saying is you're kind of assuming that there's going to be no variant that challenges the vaccine. Benjamin was saying before there could be. The point about saying it has to be irreversible, you might find yourself in a difficult place with public opinion if you assert that, then all of a sudden a variant appears that breaks through the vaccine. What do you do then and how do you get the public to buy back in?David Davis[0:33:32] One thing that will have changed after this is the public will be more cautious. In the old days we couldn't get people to take flu vaccinations. Now you will see more of that. The government's plan is going to help reduce the risk of the variant -- a new variant by passing it and so on. In the future we are going to see every September huge vaccination programmes. That will enable us to go back to normal. That's what the plan must be.
