Paul Scully[0:12:52] It's not. We have a situation here where we have to look at the process. I think if you look at the process that Owen Paterson went through, if that came to me as a constituency MP with someone in a different set of circumstances, when he was talking about the fact that it was 17 months, he had 17 witnesses, none of whom were questioned, I would want to be able to test that. I would want to have maybe a second structure, an appeal system. We also have -- we actually have two processes. We all have an independent complaints and grievance scheme that was set up with other issues around bullying, when the previous speaker was accused of bullying. That has an appeal system. This one doesn't.
