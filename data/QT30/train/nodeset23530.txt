Brian Cox[00:04:13] I think it's a mess. It's an absolute mess. I think the left hand doesn't really know what the right hand's doing on this. And clearly, I love the idea of normal life and we aren't living a normal life. What is normal life? It's certainly not like that at the moment and it's not going to be like that, whatever that may mean, eventually. But I feel that we do need to be vaccinated. We do need to be responsible. I think Scotland, I have to say, is a very good example of what's going on. I think in the south, there's a lot of headless chicken activity, quite frankly. And it's interesting that the Conservative Party are finally catching up and now they're all wearing masks, but they should have been wearing masks all the time as an example. And it's the example that's important for the people. That's what Parliament is supposed to do, they're supposed to represent the people and the needs of the people. And so the masks are terribly important, they really are. I mean, I've had COVID, I know what it's like. In fact, in my case, it wasn't too bad, but at the same time I just feel that we are a bit lax and we don't quite know what we want to do, what we're supposed to do. And I think we just have to be a little stringent in our whole policy on masks particularly.
