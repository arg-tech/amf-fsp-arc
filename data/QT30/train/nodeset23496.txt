Tim Stanley[0:19:28] Now the problem is they weren't just supporting a man with one case, which they might feel on the merits they can take his side on; they were also, in doing that, attempting to rewrite the rules. And that looks like someone has been found guilty of something and you're trying to get them off by rewriting the rules. And by screwing around in the last 48 hours, the government has ended up failing on both counts. It has undermined any case for reform because it looks like reform is a Trojan horse for getting their mate off, but they've also done something which led to an MP having to resign even though he insists he is guilty of nothing. It is a PR disaster. But only a few weeks since the death of David Amoss, a few weeks ago we were talking about the importance of remembering that MPs are human beings. It doesn't mean they should be let off things. Nevertheless, I'm telling you, behind the scenes there is a human context to this story and that's why many MPs felt obliged to support Owen Paterson.

I find it very difficult when there's a standards piece and someone is convicted in the court, both MPs, one gets hounded, has to leave, the other can still be an MP. Why don't we have the same standard for everything, when you are convicted of something, you have to leave.
