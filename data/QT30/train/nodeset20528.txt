Fiona Bruce[0:57:14] We all need to get our haircut. I speak for myself. Jim.Audience Member 22[0:57:18] I think it is disingenuous for Anneliese to say that children have lost 100 days. It is disingenuous to the children who have been working really hard remotely -- those children that have been able to, and there's quite a few of them. It is disingenuous to the teachers who have been trying to make it happen for them, and it is disingenuous to the parents who have been helping them as well.
