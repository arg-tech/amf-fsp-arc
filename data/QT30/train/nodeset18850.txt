Fiona Bruce[00:12:32] And Deborah, I’m wondering…you were asking the question and I know you’re a deputy headteacher, the way you phrase it makes me wonder if you think actually it isn’t genuinely devastating…or isn’t devastating for a generation of children?
Deborah Norrish[00:12:43] It’s been absolutely awful. This week we…so, I work in a secondary school in Plymouth and we’ve had our year tens and 12s back for the first time. And first of all, it’s absolutely delightful to see them all, but it’s absolutely horrifying that we can’t provide more, and they’re desperate for it. Attendance this week has been brilliant and, you know, clearly home learning isn’t doing the job for them that we need it to do. We haven’t got clarity yet on, you know, what’s going to happen with their exams next year and the assessment. And as school leaders we are desperate for further guidance about planning for September, and our students are becoming disillusioned at not having it, I think.
Fiona Bruce[00:13:19] Marsha, you have your hand up.
