[JENNI MURRAY] : I had an awful lot of sympathy for her as I often have -- I don't watch a lot of sport but I do watch athletics quite a lot. They come running off the track and they're rushing up to try to get to their parents to be congratulated and somebody is there with a microphone stuck under their noses. They can barely breathe. You just think no, no, no, leave them alone. What they are good at is what they do on the track. What she is good at is what she does on the tennis court. Sometimes you watch these interviews -- I do occasionally watch Wimbledon -- they are still puffed when they are being interviewed. They might not have played as well as they hoped they had, they are very embarrassed, and I'm bored. 

[FIONA BRUCE] : When you have someone like Billie Jean King I believe as professional athletes we have responsibility to make ourselves available to the media. 

[JENNI MURRAY] : Martina, who I have adored for years, she said the same thing. But that means it's just business. You know, it's the sport that I want to watch. I want to watch her whack her ball with her racket and then go home and maybe at the end of the tournament, when she's won, give a nice little speech in the mitts of the court, saying how grateful she is. But don't persist them. It is horrible.
