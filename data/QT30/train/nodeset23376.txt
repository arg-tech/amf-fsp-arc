Daniel Finkelstein[0:36:52] I hate to be in a position, because we all rely on the police force in our daily lives for maintenance of law, the rule of law, and nothing is more important to me than the rule of law. So not to be able to say yes is a total political tragedy did I for me, but I can't.Fiona Bruce[0:37:12] Jo, what about you?AudienceMember 20210624QT22[0:37:14] With these sorts of things there's a lot of mistrust in the police. The Fresh Water Five, for example, can't go to retrial. I think these things need to be addressed properly. We have a society that won't address the issues front and centre or, indeed, The House, it's a very sad day. I think that just demonstrate the lack of respect for the trust the British public should have in police forces, not just the Met Police. Has anybody considered the thoughts and feelings of this man's family? Has anybody thought about that? Five investigations, five investigations that have been failed. It's disgraceful.Fiona Bruce[0:37:58] The family has sate almost every step we found ourselves lied to, f off, bullied degraded and let down time and time and time again. Jack.AudienceMember 20210624QT23[0:38:08] Thank you. I think there are -- it's worth noting there are countless communities and groups that aren't just losing faith in the police or in other institutions because of this right now but over years and years have.
