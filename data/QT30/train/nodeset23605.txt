Minette Batters[0:25:16] Daffodils worth well over £1.3 million. We've got a flower sector that's worth £2 billion. The berry sector, we're self-sufficient in berries from April. It goes on and on and we have to resolve it. And the more we talk about low skilled, low paid, that's not the case. Butchers are on £15. Your staff nurse is on £13 an hour. So butchers are on £15 an hour, but we've got a shortage. We have got to have a dial down so we can sort this crisis and make sure that we have high quality British food on the shelves. It feels like farmers don't matter and we don't want to see British food produced in this country and that has to change. (APPLAUSE).Fiona Bruce[0:26:10] Lisa?Lisa Nandy[0:26:12] Well, farmers have been warning for months now that there is a problem with the shortage of abattoir workers and, you know, I heard what Minette said about individual ministers trying to do their bit, but what we need is the Prime Minister to get a grip on this because people are watching their livelihoods go up in smoke. My cousin is a farmer. I know how tough it is to have to work in that industry all year round with all of the pressures that are on people, but to have to slaughter perfectly well animals in the middle of a pandemic when we have seen food shortages, I mean, it really is quite an unbelievable place to have got to. There are things that could be done right now.
