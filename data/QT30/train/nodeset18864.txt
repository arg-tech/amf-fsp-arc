We all want exactly the same app doing exactly the same thing, which seems incredible. We have a very simple app where the players and the staff fill in any symptoms, because that’s as efficient a way of catching the disease early. Sometimes there’s testing, where there can be a lag between the time you test and testing positive.But, you know, developing these apps is extremely complex. You know, as somebody who had a business that developed this kind of thing, the time scales that we’re trying to do it in are very very compressed. I’m pleased today that they’re adapting to Google and Apple technology, which, you know, I would hazard a guess they might be better at producing stuff than, you know, people in our government. So, look, let’s hope that we can all get together. The blame game on both sides, I think, really does need to stop. It’s a very difficult situation, nobody was prepared for this situation.
