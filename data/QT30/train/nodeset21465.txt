[FIONA BRUCE] : Heather, I wanted to come to you, where does one find the balance between protecting someone's mental health, which Naomi O'Sacka feels she has not been supported in that way and the spectators, turning to the game want to hear from their heroes, what they felt of their play, whether they, you know, what we can learn from that. 
 
[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : I think what the spectators want to do more than anything else is watch Naomi play tennis. That, to me, is what most spectators want and, given the choice between Naomi Osaka playing tennis, being able to watch her or her not being there at all, I personally would prefer being able to watch her play tennis. As is mentioned, she is 23. You know, the mental health problems that have arisen, I think, in this pandemic, that all the work of the resolution foundation shows that it is that group, it is that age group, the under 25 age group, that have suffered more than anybody else in this pandemic. So I'm very, very pleased that Naomi Osaka has stood up on this because it called out the whole issue on the under 25 age group.
