Vaughan Gething [00:45:06] We’re now in a much better place, we have well over 12,000 tests available daily if we need them in Wales. To give you an idea, if that were equivalent for the whole of the UK, we’d have a UK capacity of well over 260,000 tests, so actually we have more than, if you like, the share of the whole UK capacity would be because of the programme we have successfully implemented. When it comes to turning around test results, we’re actually in a decent place, but I want to see us get better, it will help us to maintain public confidence in test, trace and protect, if we can turn around those tests even faster. So, I’m committed to understanding what we can do to make it better, openly publishing the data we have, and to give that confidence to people. So, the facts, I think, don’t bear out the comments that Liz has actually made.Liz Saville-Roberts [00:46:18] Can I just say one thing?Fiona Bruce [00:46:19] Briefly, Liz, ’cause I need to get around the panel.Liz Saville-Roberts [00:46:20] Contact testing was started in Wales, and stopped almost immediately. The only place where it carried on was Ceredigion, where they’ve had the lowest deaths and the lowest rate, I think 61 amongst 100,000 of infection.
