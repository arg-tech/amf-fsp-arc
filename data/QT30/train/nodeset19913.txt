Fiona Bruce[00:53:48] A few more hands up. Liam. It was your question, actually.
Liam[00:53:52] Just a couple of points. Arlene stated that, obviously she’s British and no one can take that away from her. I don’t think no one wants to take that away from her. I think any referendum is not about taking none’s Britishness away. Anand is saying about the here and now, the key is to make the protocol work in the here and now. One of the key things is you have to plan for this day coming, this referendum because we have to learn from the shambles that was the Brexit referendum and we have to make sure that any unity referendum is not like the Brexit referendum and people have a clear, concise knowledge of what it is they are voting for. We need to make sure. If the referendum isn’t for another 10 years, we need to start planning now.
