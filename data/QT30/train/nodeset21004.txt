Fiona Bruce[00:13:36] Hang on a sec. Angela, you've got your hand up.

Angela Unknown[00:13:39] Nerinda mentioned at the very start about focusing on the independence referendum, or building the economy and recovering the health service. To me they're not mutually exclusive. We can still have an independence referendum and still focus on these areas. SNP has seen a huge rise in NHS spending. We've the most GPs, nurses, midwives, dentists and NHS staff per head across Britain. We have the best performing accident and emergency units, we have free prescriptions and eye tests. So, to me they are not mutually exclusive, we can still have an independence referendum and we can still focus on these key priority areas.
