Emily Thornberry[0:15:16] The current process we have is one whereby more than half-of the people on the panel are members of the public. What happened yesterday was the to use that you are majority and sweep away all of that, sweep away all of that do have them make a fundamental change to our constitution and decide they were going to introduce a committee that was going to be dominated by --coronavirus, that was com innate by MPs, not have any members of the chaired by a Conservative so they could do whatever they wanted. That isn't the way we do things in this country. We need to have an independent panel and we have to be very careful that, once all the fuss is gone, they don't try to introduce some skewed system that will allow them to do what they like because they are not above the law. They are not above the law and they should make sure they stick to the rules like everyone else. You cannot, if you are found to have broken the rules, simply decide that you're going to change them. That is not the way you behave in this country.
