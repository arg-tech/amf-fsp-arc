Fiona Bruce[00:05:45] Okay, Katie? 
Katie[00:05:46] Hiya, basically, yes, so my example is that my mum moved to France last year and I've not been able to see her since then, and I think much as I completely get not going abroad, I do get it, I get the vaccine not being rolled out as much over there, it all makes sense genuinely, but I think it's like if there was a better way that it was handled when people were coming into the country initially, or even now, like, should we not have come up with some kind of better system by now a year in so that we know that when people are coming in, likeâ€¦even like I've been to France sort of last summer and I came back and I got the train home from London and no one called me for ten days.
