Fiona Bruce [00:02:38] Scotland has an infection growth rate than England. Kate Forbes [00:02:46] We also have the lowest 100,000, those are the figures that matter. Because we suppressed it so low during the summer, schools and universities went back earlier, we’re seeing figures increase which is why early action is key to avoid a complete lockdown. I think that Nicola Sturgeon has done that. Certainly this week’s figures in terms of dissatisfaction with the prime minister in Scotland is very high. It is almost the inverse; 76 percent are dissatisfied with the way the prime minister has handled it. From my perspective, the challenge for every government, not just the UK but across the world, is to suppress the virus, keep the trust of the people and ensure we manage these other harms in terms of the economy or society more widely.
