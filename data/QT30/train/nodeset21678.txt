Andy Burnham[0:37:22] The point Nicola made, we should be having daily testing of the contacts. There are about 400,000 kids at home who are contacts of people who tested positive. That is not sustainable. We have not had policies that have realised why, such as supporting people with no access to sick pay to self-isolate if they are ill. This is a point we made all the way through the pandemic. The government has never dealt with it. You have to deal with things like that. Put booster supplies into the areas where cases have been highest, have an approach that realises that health is poorest in some parts.

AudienceMember 20210708QT11[0:38:08] Yes, Fiona, thank you again. I'm very privileged to work in a vaccination centre. Three weeks ago we were vaccinating people in their mid-30s, two weeks ago early 30s, last week we were vaccinating people in their 20s. At the same time in Durham there was a pop-up vaccination centre in the town centre for anybody over the age of 18. The vaccination programme is accelerating at a phenomenal rate. I'm fairly confident that we will have everybody that needs to be vaccinated, vaccinated quite soon, very soon. Then, come September, we will be offering booster doses for people over the age of 50, I believe, to start off with.
