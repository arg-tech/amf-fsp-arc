Claire Fox [00:40:10] We can't engage everybody who's 18 plus, so what we'll do is we'll get lots of young people involved and there is, and there has always been a little bit of the idea that those young people, and I work with teenagers so I know how smart they can be, but also for the purposes of everything else, they're treated as not being adults. They're still at school, they're dependent and they're consequently not seen as autonomous in the usual way that we understand that politically. 

I think that probably the Labour Party hope that they will benefit from having these young people vote for them and they kind of look at opinion polls and say, oh, they're all very radical, they'll vote for us. I rather enjoyed it in the Scottish referendum when the SNP deployed a similar tactic but in the end many of those young people were independent and didn't actually vote for independence and thought for themselves. So if they're going to have the vote I hope that they won't act as a stage army for any particular political party.
