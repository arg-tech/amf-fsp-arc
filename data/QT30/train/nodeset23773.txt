Fiona Bruce[0:29:36] This isn't necessarily a poverty crisis. This is people, and not speaking for everybody but people who have been able to afford to buy their own homes and found themselves in a position where they may be forced into penury but they aren't in it because of a poverty crisis.
Danny Sriskandarajah[0:29:54] We know that more people fell into poverty. If you take each of the issues and lay it upon each other, the insecurity that people feel that will drive more people into poverty.
Fiona Bruce[0:30:04] OK. Let's take another question now from Tim.
AudienceMember 20210916QT16[0:30:10] Hi. With Covid cases and deaths in India continuing to increase, is the British Government doing enough to support India?
Fiona Bruce[0:30:16] Daisy?
Daisy Cooper[0:30:20] No. I don't think the UK Government is doing enough to support India. I know the UK Government has sent medical supplies but we absolutely vitally need the Government to do is to send vaccines. So back in February, the Liberal Democrats wrote to the Government and said after the first four million most vulnerable people in the UK have been vaccinated, we think that the Government should embark on a parallel roll-out of the vaccine through the UK and through Kofax which is the international vaccine scheme.
