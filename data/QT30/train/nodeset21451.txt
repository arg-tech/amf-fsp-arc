[JENNI MURRAY] : I think, like the entire population, or most of the population, who are neither economists or scientists, I am completely confused. I'm 71 years old. I would really love everything to open up again. I want to be able to go inside a restaurant -- okay, it is sunny now, but when it is rainy and cold I would love to go inside a restaurant with my family and friends. Life to go back to normal. Have a good life for so long as I may have left. But I don't know. I was watching Newsnight the other night and they were discussing the 21st as it -- and one scientist, just like you, so no, no, we can't open up. We must keep this virus down. We mustn't let it spread again. And the other one said: No, it will be fine. We'll be okay. You know, we had lots of vaccinations. I'm double vaccinated and I keep getting tested regularly, but I'm still scared. I'm scared of getting it. My age group is kind of the most at-risk one and you just frighten me by saying how little protection I have with my double vaccine.
