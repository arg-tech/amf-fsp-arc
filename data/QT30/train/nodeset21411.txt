Fiona Bruce[0:53:45] Devi.
Professor Devi Sridhar [00:53:46] Yeah. I mean, we have international human rights law exactly for this and we have seen clear breaches of it. We have seen children under attack, we have seen medical facilities under attack, doctors as well as journalists. These are supposed to be protected groups and yet we have seen even today the head of Gaza's COVID-19 programme killed which will have ramifications for the people living there. So I guess it's a deep problem. There's no easy solutions. But the international community need to come back to that there have been agreed international law and that states need to abide by that and try to get that compliance through pressure of the international community.
