Fiona Bruce[0:29:50] Let me come back to you, Rosemary. You wanted to come back into the conversation.
Rosemary Squire[0:29:58] The vaccines work, deaths are rising very slightly. What I want to say for my industry is we need to go back to work. It is terrible. There are genuinely people -- this is a world-leading business. We are best in class in the world. Look at Netflix, all the Sky channels, all the television stations, they come from British stage schools, British training, British theatre. We are great at it. Please, let us get back to work. And the Government must support us in our industry.
Fiona Bruce[0:30:32] Just in terms of facts and figures, so many different facts and figures we can bandy around. Hospital admissions have risen by 43%. The numbers are smaller than they were.
Sarah Jones[0:30:44] They are doubling every 7 to 12 days.
Fiona Bruce[0:30:46] Andy.
AudienceMember 20210624QT19[0:30:48] What we need to understand here is that even our experts are still learning. The chief scientific officers, chief medical officers, this is a new disease. We are still learning. Because one model was done doesn't necessarily mean that's the only model that's ever going to be right. Things will change, people will learn more, models will change, scientific opinion will change and I'm stunned Mark could tell whether or not a model was correct because I imagine that most scientists in the country, forget chief medical officers, will tell you that models are potentially out of date the minute they are created because there will be more factors.
