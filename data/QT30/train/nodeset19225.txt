FIONA BRUCE [00:22:06] Another question from Joe Craft. 
[JOE]: Is the storage facility in place to guarantee the vaccine? 
FIONA BRUCE [00:22:24] This is difficult. You need the superfreezers. The Scottish government has bought some of these superfreezers. Are you going to be able to pull this off? 
MATT HANCOCK [00:22:34] Yes. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:22:34] You sound very confident. I remember you coming in here and talking about PPE in the first wave.[DONE] 
MATT HANCOCK [00:22:42] On PPE I remember explaining how difficult it was. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:22:48] You also said weâ€™ll have it sorted by the weekend. 
MATT HANCOCK [00:22:52] And we got there. But on this, the NHS is in charge of distributing it. So the UK government is buying this vaccine and the other vaccines, and it is important we have a portfolio, that we have several. And we are buying them for the whole UK. Then the NHS, in each country, in England, Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland, is responsible for the deployment. It is a challenge. It is incredibly difficult. I would add one more challenge, Joe, you talked about the execution and the storage -- distribution and storage. There is one other part which is in the vaccine Pfizer are doing. But these things are hard to manufacture.[DONE]
