Fiona Bruce[00:07:06] Ian? Ian Unknown [00:07:07] Yes, hello. It would be nice for somebody to tell us what we have to do to achieve the freedoms that we had before. They keep on about it needs to be low, it needs to be down. Do we need to be like New Zealand and Australia, every time they get an infection it just shuts down? To me, that can't continue to happen. New Zealand and Australia have to eventually open up and you can guarantee that they're going to get some sort of infection in there and you can't go along hoping that it's just going to disappear, because it's not, and you've got to go back to some sort of normality and we need to be told when that or what we need to achieve to get to that point.
