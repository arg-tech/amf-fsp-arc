Fiona Bruce [0:20:42] Let’s hear a bit more from our audience. Lots of hands up. Donna.
Female Aud 3 [0:20:43] Just going back to the culture of the Labour party, I think since the appointment of Keir Starmer I think he really has a stamped a clear message regarding it. Okay, yes, we can’t turn back what’s happened, but hopefully the message he’s sent out with obviously the dismissal of Rebecca Long Baily early doors I think that sends hopefully a clearer message going forward.
Fiona Bruce [0:21:13] Alex.
Male Aud 1 [0:21:14] As a young person that’s been brought up being taught about the horrors of the holocaust I feel like it’s absolutely ludicrous that things like this are still happening in today’s politics, and people need to be held accountable for it.
Marie van der Zyl[ 0:21:27] I agree. Absolutely. You don’t expect antisemitism in the opposition party. It’s unimaginable. Let alone being found guilty of victimisation and harassment.
Fiona Bruce [0:21:37] Miles.
Male Aud 2 [0:21:39] Good evening. I think it’s a terrible shame to see what the Labour party did, but as MPs how are we going to change that in the future so there is no hate crime in any political party anywhere. For anybody that does work for the government, who wants to become a member of parliament, they know that they are safe where they’re working.
