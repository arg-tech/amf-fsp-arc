There are men that are very much discriminated against in our society and I think we have to be very careful about the narrative here.Fiona Bruce[0:09:16] In terms of domestic violence against men, it exists, you're absolutely right. Not in the same numbers as it does against women.AudienceMember 20210318QT07[0:09:26] I agree with that. I also feel there is this nuance towards "all men are evil." Putting that in people's minds is very dangerous. We need to be mindful about our activities. I'm not saying it doesn't happen but you have to be responsible for your own self and making your own decisions. You wouldn't cross a road not looking both ways, are you going to get hit by a car. We have to take responsibility for our own selves.
