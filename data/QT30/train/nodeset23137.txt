Fiona Bruce[00:25:52] Well, the question, Vaughan, is do you agree that vaccine nationalism is now the greatest threat to public health in the UK and Europe?

Vaughan Gething[00:25:58] No, I don't but I think everyone just needs to take a step back and calm down. I think the rhetoric for some of the comments and the commentary around this is really unhelpful for all of us. 

Fiona Bruce[00:26:07] Coming from where?

Vaughan Gething[00:26:10] From lots of different sides, actually, I think. I think it's been some of the European leadership I don't think has been helpful, some of the comments from this side I don't think have helped that either. What we do have is a situation where we have ordered more than enough to vaccinate the UK. The reality is we're going to vaccinate our population but we also need to see the balance that Nigel's referred to about how we have a balance in helping other parts of the world, Europe and others, and in Europe, now that there's clear acceptance on the safety and efficacy of AstraZeneca, they need to get on with vaccinating people with the vaccines they've got, and lots of this is about a commercial dispute between the European Union and the vaccine companies, and it's about us not muddying the waters and making it more difficult.
