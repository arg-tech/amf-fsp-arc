Fiona Bruce[0:39:32] In the letter you wrote on Monday I think it was, you talked about when we have a surplus of vaccines, we should be giving vaccines to countries like India, at what point do you think we get to a surplus of vaccines are we at that point now?Jon Ashworth[0:39:46] I think we have to play our part in vaccines in drugs, but I thinkFiona Bruce[0:39:50] What does that mean when it comes to vaccines? Should we be sending vaccines to India now? Jon Ashworth[0:39:56] Part of the issue in India is yes they need access to vaccines and investment in their Primary Care networks to get the vaccines distributed. What we also need.Fiona Bruce[0:40:06] Your position from the vaccines, and you wrote this in your letter on Monday, and a surplus of vaccines should be sent to India. Is your surplus different to the Government and then sending them. Our position is different. What is it?Jon Ashworth[0:40:26] What we desperately need is an international agreement about shared intellecture property rights on vaccination. What we need is investment in vaccination manufacturing capacity.Fiona Bruce[0:40:36] You think the property rights should be loosened?Jon Ashworth[0:40:38] We need an international agreement on that urgently. We need an international agreement on investing in the manufacturing capability in parts of the world so they can start doing their own vaccine manufacturing, and India can manufacturer but there's many parts of the world that can't. We need an international agreement around genomic sequences.
