Fiona Bruce[00:48:26] Well, we're discussing it simply because that was the question. I mean, one of those stabbings was of a 14-year-old, particularly distressing. The question is, what, if any, further protection should politicians have? I mean, you're all talking about if politicians feel concerned, they should have protection. But what should they be? Is it having a police officer stationed at every constituency surgery, or what is it? Practically, what does it mean?Kate Forbes[00:48:47] I mean, it's not that, is it? Because the bread and butter of my job is surgeries with constituents. It's meeting people face to face. Now through COVID that's been more difficult, I've had virtual surgeries, but you cannot escape, and I would never want to, it's the part of the job I love the most. Being out in my very beautiful constituency, almost as beautiful as Glasgow, and meeting people face to face. But I don't think there is any politician, I can't think of any, who haven't had to face threatening behaviour, who haven't been subject to intimidating threats. And the challenge for all of us is that the worst atrocities start somewhere and they start with these intimidating threats. They start with anger-fuelled and dehumanising language so often on social media.
