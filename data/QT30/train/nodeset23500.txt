AudienceMember 20211111QT13[0:37:50] With all the restrictions in 2020 that were put on us by the pandemic, carbon emissions globally fell by 5 percent. Are we kidding ourselves about the seismic sense that's needed to really reduce carbon levels down?
Fiona Bruce[0:38:06] We would have to go into some kind of lockdown, is what you are saying? Caroline, I don't know what your view is about that. You are hearing some optimistic views, are you?
Caroline Lucas[0:38:18] I think there has been incremental steps forward. In terms of trying to measure whether or not you feel optimistic, it feels there are two ways of measuring that. On the one hand the world of what's deemed to be currently politically possible, and in that world with, yes, the small steps forward are welcome, although there are big questions about how the deforestation agreement will be enforced, the fact that on the finance agreement it is still not clear whether or not companies are still going to be able to fund fossil fuels, it looks as if they are, so there are issues there. But compared to the transformative change that it requires, and let's not forget what is at stake here, the future of small island states and the rest of us, too, then compared to that kind of way of measuring progress we are still a long way off.
