Fiona Bruce[0:54:10] I know that Labour does not agree with the 1 percent. What do you think they should get as a pay rise?
Steve Reed[0:54:16] There was a percentage the government had budgeted for.
Fiona Bruce[0:54:22] Do you think that's enough?
Steve Reed[0:54:22] I think that should be the minimum they should be getting.
Fiona Bruce[0:54:26] I know Labour has been very critical. What percent do you think?
Steve Reed[0:54:32] At least the 2.1 percent the government promised the NHS workers. We have to pay the review body to look at this, this is a normal part of the process.
Fiona Bruce[0:54:42] What do you think they should get?
Steve Reed[0:54:44] At least 2.1 percent. I want to agree with what Victor said because he absolutely hit the nail on the head here. Nurses and other NHS workers, because hospital porters, hospital cleaners, all the rest of them over this past year have sweat blood and tears to look after the rest of us. They've gone in there where COVID existed and put their lives on the line to look after the rest of us, keep us safe. They literally saved the prime minister's life. When the British people stood out on the doorsteps week after week applauding those workers, they meant it. But when Boris Johnson finished clapping he went inside Number 10 Downing Street and slammed the door in their faces and insulted them with a pay cut. It's not me saying a pay cut.
