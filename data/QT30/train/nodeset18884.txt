Fiona Bruce[00:49:47] Steve, let me bring you back to Laura’s original question. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister announced a review into racial inequality in the country – isn’t now the time for action rather than just another review?Steve Parish[00:50:00] I absolutely think it’s time for action. I mean, you know, we have some experience of this; we have a big academy with 212 boys in it at any one time and, you know, there are many many facets of this problem that we all accept exists. One of the biggest ones that I see is really based around social mobility. And the frustrating thing for me is that we all have it in our power to make a difference. You know, again, this is one of those things we can put to government, or we can make a change. And, you know, what I see in the boys that we’ve got is that they don’t have…even if they’re, you know, academically strong or bright, they don’t have the networks that we have. They don’t get the opportunities that people in our network get.
