Grant Shapps [0:17:48] When I speak to the chief medical officer, it is the first thing they say, outdoor is much safer than indoor. Once you introduce alcohol into it as well, once you introduce more people into it, unfortunately -- these things all add up. Jo is right in a sense that a lot of the time you could say we could do A, B or C and what's the logic between them. The answer is you have to make a distinction somewhere. Our distinction is we think schools should go back first. That does use up a bit of the budget for the R, the reproduction rate. We could say we'll send hospitality back first, but we won't send schools back. That would be the wrong thing to do. wrong thing to do. Listening to this conversation, I know how frustrating it is, we want to open up, but we have been providing 280 billion pounds of support so far in the hospitality sector, the VAT cut, which I take James' point, if you are not earning, it is not the be all and end all.
