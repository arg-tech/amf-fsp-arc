FIONA BRUCE [00:48:00] Antonio? ANTONIO UNKNOWN [00:48:02] My question is for Matt. Matt has mentioned that there are several companies, several deals going on regarding the vaccine. I just want to know, these pharmaceutical companies involved will make enormous amounts of money. My question to Matt is this. Does the government have any strategies in place to ensure that these pharmaceutical companies give back to the country from their profits to make sure that everybody in the UK who wants the vaccine can have it, rather than being held to ransom or on what they can produce and what the government wants to pay for the vaccine? FIONA BRUCE [00:48:50] Justin. JUSTIN UNKNOWN [00:48:54] While this announcement is welcome, does Mr Hancock think it goes anywhere to increasing an apathetic population who have been drip-fed a series of failures, costly failures and double standards? FIONA BRUCE [00:49:12] Joe. JOE KRAFT [00:49:16] Yes, I think the arguments are given that the NHS will be able to manage the roll-out, the NHS will do it. The NHS relies on subcontractors to do the job of rolling it out. Recently the vetting has suffered and Iâ€™ve also heard rumours that there are simply not enough medical grade vials or lorries around or even PPE for the rollout of this vaccine. So to say the NHS will do it, well, the NHS can only do it if they get the support to do their job. So, you know, it would be a monumental waste of money to buy the vaccine and then not having it transported and it becoming ineffective.[DONE]
