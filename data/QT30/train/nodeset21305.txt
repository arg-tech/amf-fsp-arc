Fiona Bruce[00:37:17] There's people in our audience here, some agreeing, some putting their hands in their hands. I want to move on, take another question, but I'm just going to hear quickly from a few of you. Andi?

Andi Unknown[00:37:27] I just want to say what planet are you guys on? We had a conversation not very… 15 minutes ago maybe about being respectful, about supporting each other. We've got people mudslinging, we've got people… the question was is there a mandate, not who can tie each other up in knots and moan at each other. This is a question we're trying, as members of the public, and I say this to all panel members, as members of the public we're trying to engage with you and many, many members of this panel have said let's not mudsling, let's not do this, let's not do that. How many times, you're all sitting there saying you want to listen, listen to us, stop moaning at each other, stop bitching at each other, figure out how to work together. That is the only way this country is going to get better. You know, never point at fat cats when the leader of the Labour Party's a very, very successful lawyer. You're pointing at fat cats in the Conservative Party. What a load of rubbish.

Fiona Bruce[00:38:38] Okay.
