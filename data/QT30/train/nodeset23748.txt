Fiona Bruce[0:48:57] Okay. Let me just put this in context. I'm not entirely sure that vaccinations is the issue, as far as I'm aware, most vaccinations happen outside GP surgeries, but the Royal Collegeâ€¦the head of the Royal College of GPs has been addressing this issue, it was pre-pandemic that 80 per cent of appointments were carried out face to face with GPs, it's now something like 57 per cent, and the head of the Royal College of GPs says he thinks 56 per cent is about right, so you then have the prime minister saying people actually should be able to see their GP face to face if they want to. So you've asked this question. Is this because you're involved, you're a GP, or you've got a personal interest?
AudienceMember 20210930QT33[0:49:32] Just a patient, and I understand the pressures on the system, it's just what can we do, what can we do to help?
Fiona Bruce[0:49:38] And do you want to be able to see your GP face to face when you want?
AudienceMember 20210930QT34[0:49:40] Ideally yes, yes, ideally.
