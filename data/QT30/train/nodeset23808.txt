You've completely upended somebody's country, their social structure, their political structure - in some cases, their religious and cultural structure - and now we're just saying, "Oh, well, anyway, it doesn't seem to be working, let's go." At some point, people have to take responsibility for that. I don't care if it Labour, Conservative, British, American, who it is. We've gone in, we've made a mess. We have to take responsibility to that mess.
