Fiona Bruce[0:49:10] Okay. Hands up amongst our audience. Kofie.
Kofie[0:49:16] Just in relation to that question about what changes should be kept. I particularly am interested to know with the whole new regime of wearing masks going on public transport, going forward in the long term would that be maintained? And also, will shops and stores, any of them, public gatherings, adopt a policy where we have to wear a mask if we want to be in the shop and will there always be, particularly in gyms, like a restricted number of people who can enter the gym at a time?
Fiona Bruce[0:49:50] Is that something you want to see then permanent, you know, a permanence to face coverings, that sort of thing?
Kofie[0:50:02] Yeah, in particular spaces, probably like maybe shops and gyms and even public transport. Because when you are coming in contact with so many people like that, then we are still -- this virus, there is still a lot we don't know about it and the rates of transmission. I think it's important that we still have that protection and maintain the policy, as we said like this is a new normal.
