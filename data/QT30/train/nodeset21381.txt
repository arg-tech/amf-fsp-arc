[00:23:59] Well, obviously we're waiting to see more information from Public Health England, but the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation and of course the early clinical evidence from Oxford laboratory evidence is that the vaccines work on the so called Indian…the B1617.2 variant, and as Professor Van-Tam said yesterday that he's feeling it's maybe a little bit more infectious, so maybe 20, 30 per cent, not the 50 per cent more infectious. So we need to keep vaccinating at scale. The important thing is to continue with the vaccination programme, people come forward and test…

Fiona Bruce
[00:24:40] Okay. But in terms of what we might be hearing either tomorrow or the next few days, are you expecting good news?

Nadhim Zahawi
[00:24:46] Obviously Public Health England will share data when the data comes through on this.

Fiona Bruce
[00:24:51] Okay. I'll do my best to get it out of you, Nadhim. I'll keep trying throughout the programme. Harriet, did the government close the borders too late when it comes to India?

Harriet Green
[00:24:59] Well, I think already…

Fiona Bruce
[00:24:59] In fact, well, of course the border isn't closed because people can still come in from India but they now have to quarantine.
