[0:24:33] I don't think Boris Johnson has a mandate to say to the Scottish people it was a once in a lifetime referendum. You only have to look at the way Boris Johnson treats the SNP group down at Westminster in debate. If no one watched, he treats them with total disregard. The Scottish people wanted to remain in the EU, that's been disrespected. It is now clear there's a mandate from the Scottish people and if there's a clear mandate in May with an overwhelming majority SNP government, I think Boris Johnson has no choice but to give the Scottish people their wish and grant them another referendum.

[0:25:12] I think the handling of the pandemic has shown there will be divides after it's over. We don't have the flexibility up here to do a lot other than what we're getting from Westminster. We need to take control of our own destiny in some ways and look after our own affairs and not be cowtowing with him about all these topics. Let's have another referendum.

[0:25:44] I'm an SNP supporter. I voted for independence. If Boris doesn't want -- he needs to get the SNP name right.
