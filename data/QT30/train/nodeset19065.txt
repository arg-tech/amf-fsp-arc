Fiona Bruce Mark, do you feel that either government is listening to the advice at SAGE? 
Mark Walport [00:05:54] Yes. I think it is the wrong question that has been asked because it is not a question of internal comparisons, it is looking at other countries that are doing well. So South Korea, Vietnam, Germany. I think what we have to do is learn from what is working well in other countries. Frankly, I think it would be easier if there was a bit more commonality in the approach across all the countries of the UK. 
Fiona Bruce [00:06:16] We saw the advice released by SAGE this week, the advice given to the governments on 21 September. From what we can see, neither the Scottish government or the UK government are following much of the advice that SAGE was giving. 
Mark Walport [00:06:36] The bottom line is SAGE is looking through the lens of controlling the pandemic. They are also having to balance the difficult tight rope of the miserable health consequences for other people as well, which is the effects of the economic damage -- the unemployment, the damage to education. But I think what we have to do is we need a really clear strategy. I think that has been less visible. What we have to do, frankly, is learn to live with the virus while working on therapeutics and vaccines. We have to get it under control but keep it under control with much better public health delivery.
