[FIONA BRUCE] : Phil, you asked the question. I could see you shaking your head. 
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : It came back earlier. The conservative there mentioned, well, things will get back to normal. Well, people are still on furlough, people still aren't back in work. So when they're back to normal, fine then look at this, the way the rent is paid, whatever. Don't say we're doing it now because things eventually will get back to normal. It is being done too early. People are worried now about being evicted. They're worried about losing their job and the next thing they're going to be worried about is whether they are going to lose their house as well.
