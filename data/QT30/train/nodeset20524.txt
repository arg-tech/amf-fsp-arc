Audience Member 19[0:51:26] I've seen, you know, awful effects on mental health from my family who are at school, my friends. It has been so difficult. And I think it is all well and good, Jo, saying that teachers need a break. These are young, developing minds, it is a million times worse for them. If we are talking about the implications of adults and their mental health, think about the children. I think it is important that these things are done individually. Most people have had different issues that have shaped them. I think that trying to roll out the same thing for everyone doesn't work, especially when it is young people because everyone leads such different lives and everyone learns so differently. It is not a one size fits all.
