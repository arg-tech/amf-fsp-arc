Fiona Bruce[00:07:26] Belinda, I was just watching you there, nodding your head along to what Lisa was saying.Belinda[00:07:33]Yes, you know, looking at the root of the question that Charlie asked, in terms of what does it say about the government and, like you say, you know, it took such a high profile footballer for that to happen. If we’re responding to coronavirus, and I admit there’s millions that have been ploughed into this, in order to get to that new normal, how can we trust that the government is going to make those decisions without having the intervention?Fiona Bruce[00:08:10] Munira?Munira Wilson[00:08:12] Well, in 2020 in the United Kingdom no child should be going hungry, and the fact that it’s taken a footballer to help the government to realise that and actually change its policy I think is shameful, frankly. It’s not a new issue, holiday hunger; we know that several billion children suffer from holiday hunger normally, and that’s obviously exacerbated by the crisis that we face.Fiona Bruce[00:08:39] And were the Lib Dems pushing to extend the free school meal vouchers?
