Nick Ferrari[0:36:22] It will be controlled. When the truckers crisis blew up, we can't get truckers in, but ballet dancers allowed into this country, I don't know about you guys, but I rely more on a trucker and pig farmer than a ballet dancer and you can probably tell why! Get the right people in and then train up.
Fiona Bruce[0:36:44] Nadhim, I'm going to come back to you. So many people are having a bit of a go.
Nadhim Zahawi[0:36:52] Let me address your point, Nick. You remember when countries like Poland joined the European Union. They said we would let people come and work in the UK.

When he talks about, you know, we're not going to have uncontrolled immigration because he wants the students I look after, the skills that we're developing in boot camps, whether it is for HGV and we've had a phenomenal response to the boot camp that we're launching next month...
