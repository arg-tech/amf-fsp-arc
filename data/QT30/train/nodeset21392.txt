Fiona Bruce[00:27:43] Okay. And let me hear from Hannah.Hannah Unknown[00:27:47] Hi, yeah, we're talking about India specifically and to Collette's question. I appreciate there may not have been a variant of concern, but we know that the coronavirus mutates when it's in high circulation. If you've got a very small, localised cases of coronavirus you're less likely to get a mutation. So based on the numbers that we had from India, based on what was happening, we know a variant was likely. So I think there may not have been a variant of concern, but it should have been expected. It wasn't unreasonable to expect a variant of concern and therefore to shut borders earlier before you found it. It wasn't unreasonable.Fiona Bruce[00:28:29] Okay. I'm going to move on and take another question now. We've had a number of people wanting to ask about this. Let's hear from Fatima Bhula.
