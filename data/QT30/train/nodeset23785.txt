[0:45:48] To Danny's point, it's really important, we are still the third largest overseas development aid donor in the G7. And the Chancellor has set out clearly once our finances are in a better place he wishes to take us back to 0. 7 that's a decision that's been taken

Fiona Bruce
[0:46:04] Are you happy the budget has been cut?

Anne-Marie Trevelyan
[0:46:06] I think none of us are happy. We want to do it. But the reality.

Fiona Bruce
[0:46:10] Is it a decision you agree with?

Anne-Marie Trevelyan
[0:46:12] The decision was taken and the Foreign Secretary has set-out his priorities, and how that

Fiona Bruce
[0:46:18] Do you agree?

Anne-Marie Trevelyan
[0:46:20] Um... I think it's very, very difficult to see any cuts in those bilateral programmes, but choices have to be made, and you know

Fiona Bruce
[0:46:28] The sense that you didn't agree with it don't want to say?

Anne-Marie Trevelyan
[0:46:32] Fallen on the Foreign Secretary to make the choices. He set out where his priorities, and one of them was Covid. With Kofax which we helped to set up last year we have the opportunity. The really important point on the vaccines is we don't have a surplus and we are working on a one-in, one out, and Tim's challenge is a really interesting one, and I would take that back, and say that should we be asking those who are, and the vulnerable who are young have been vaccinated so if you had healthcare issues, is for the healthy young is that a question we should be asking? The Prime Minister made a good choice, and all of us felt that was a very good decision, and we have you know, in fact demonstrated one of the most impressive vaccine roll-outs, and incredible effort.
