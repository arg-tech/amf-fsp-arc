Fiona Bruce[00:22:48] Richard.
Richard Walker[00:22:50] Yeah, I think to answer Collette's question, time will tell. We're right in the middle of this 3D game of chess, and certainly where we're standing today with a bit of hindsight of course we wish that we'd have closed India off earlier and maybe delayed the spread of that virus coming to our shores. But I think we're still in the middle of this and therefore we do need more time effectively to judge. But the one thing I would just like to add is I think Nadhim and his team have done a remarkable job on the vaccine rollout, which of course is genuinely world leading and is well on the way to our ultimate cure which is of course getting everyone vaccinated. I think it has been really impressive. There's obviously a lot more to do, but ultimately that's our main battle against this awful disease.
Fiona Bruce[00:23:45] Nadhim, are we going to be getting information tomorrow about quite how well the vaccination programme is working against the Indian variant? I noticed you were looking pretty chipper when you arrived at the studio today, I kind of got the feeling that good news might be coming. Can you tell us anything?
