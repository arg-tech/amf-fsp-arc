Grant Shapps[0:07:20]Of course, we all want to help people in society. I mean, I actually accept, by the way, that everybody, the other politicians on this panel want to do the same thing as well, of course we do. This was introduced for a specific purpose over the coronavirus. We're coming to the end of that in the same way as we're coming to the end of furlough. If we want to carry on doing things, we have to be able to pay for those things as well, and as I say, we boosted up other benefits in order to help people through what's been a difficult period.
Fiona Bruce[0:07:51] Okay, Kate.
Kate Andrews[0:07:53] Yeah, it does feel like there's something intrinsically unfair about this, like it's a cliff edge for those who are most vulnerable, but who are also trying to work, trying to earn an income, and just not quite getting there. As Grant says, we are in dangerous territory if emergency measures from COVID get rolled over into normal public policy without a debate, without a discussion about it. The government was very generous and spent a lot of money on paying people's wages through furlough, of increase welfare, now we have to separate that policy from the pandemic and have a proper discussion about if we want to prioritise this, how far up the priority list is it, how are we going to fund it, and what are we potenâ€¦what resources might be move around to do that? Now, David said his job is to oppose the government. I do wonder about that.
