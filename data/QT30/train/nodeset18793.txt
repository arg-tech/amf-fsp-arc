Hanna[0:11:42] I think what Suresh said about people accepting the risk is not the full story, you accept the risk for yourself by breaking lockdown, by wishing that lockdown was over sooner. But you don't accept the risk for people like key workers who don't have a choice, they have to leave the house. For example, my dad was 55. He was a key worker and he passed away from Coronavirus.
Fiona Bruce[0:12:06] Hanna, I am sorry to hear that. Hanna: When you say that people can make their own choice and accept the risk, you also accept the risk for the people that you will infect.
Fiona Bruce[0:12:16] Of course, that's the different thing about this pandemic, isn't it? It's not necessarily just the risk you take on yourself, it's how you affect other people as well.
