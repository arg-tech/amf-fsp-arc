MATT HANCOCKWe’ll get to, I hope, should a vaccine come off, and of course it is still uncertain, we’ll get more than 50 percent. That’s because we’ve learned more about the details of both the virus and the vaccine. DAVID LAMMY [00:21:00] In a week? MATT HANCOCK [00:21:02] No, the comments you refer to were some time ago. The expert body who advises on this has published its interim recommendations a few weeks ago. Then it will publish the final recommendations when we get the final data about the vaccine -- about any vaccine -- should it be both effective and safe. Those are the two critical things that we’ll look into. [DONE]FIONA BRUCE [00:21:28] If people can pay for it, will they get it more quickly? MATT HANCOCK [00:21:32] I don’t think that’s going to be possible. FIONA BRUCE [00:21:34] Does that mean the government is going to buy up all the doses so people won’t be able to go to a private doctor and say I’d like that. I may not be in this phase, I may not be eligible according to government guidelines, but I’ll buy it so I’ll have it. MATT HANCOCK [00:21:48] I don’t foresee this. It has been hard enough buying this as a government. The deals those who develop the vaccine have done has been with government. We have bought on behalf of the whole UK population, then we intend to roll out according to clinical priority.
