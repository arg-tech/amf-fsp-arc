Vaughan Gething[00:36:10] So I know Andrew is bravely talking about that he wouldn't have a one per cent pay cap here in Wales, but the reality is he supported austerity for ten years, and if actually the Treasury are only going to fund one per cent, that's got real consequences not just for health and social care workers but actually for wider public finances and our ability to support businesses as well. So there's quite a lot to this but I'm really clear about where we are, we've got a good track record in recruiting and retaining staff in Wales, in the last four years our NHS headcount has risen by Â£10,000 so we've put our money where our mouth is and we do have more staff. I'll need more of those staff to take care of you and me in the future as well. 
Fiona Bruce[00:36:51] Andrew?
Andrew Unknown[00:36:54] Hi, Fiona. I'd just like to say the NHS have been responsible for saving many lives and been a foundation for getting this country back on their feet, so I think we definitely should be matching four per cent, even more. I think this government's found money for everything else, why not find the money for these people on the front line?
