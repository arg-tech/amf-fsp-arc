Fiona Bruce[00:48:50] Rhian? 
Rhian Unknown[00:48:52] Hi, yes, I don't think we give young people enough credit. I'm a secondary school teacher and I had an A-level class this morning and a lot of the discussion I feel was a lot more informative and helpful to each other. They listened to each other. We don't give them enough credit and I would say that they are young adults rather than children, 16 and 17-year-olds, they've got a lot to say, and they are differing opinions, and I think they should have that opportunity to vote. And if they don't want to use that vote then they don't have to but I think the option should be there. 
Fiona Bruce[00:49:36] So, Nigel, the question is in the forthcoming May elections, which political party will benefit the most from 16 and 17-year-olds being able to vote? 
Nigel Owens[00:49:45] The honest answer to you, Fiona, I don't know.
