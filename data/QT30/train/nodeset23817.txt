AudienceMember 20210902QT26[0:26:18] (21) I feel at least with Rory, you know where you stand, you might not agree with it, he is saying troops should stay. I don't get Labour's position on this, and I don't understand the role that you played, Lisa, in terms of putting pressure on the government. I don't understand when I hear from you and Keir Starmer, I don't get a good feel. I haven't seen an impassioned, heartfelt speech in the - no doubt this evening. Where has that been in the last 18 months? You haven't been clear on your position and what pressure have you put on the government around the exit strategy?
Fiona Bruce[0:26:52] This was put to you in the House of Commons today, according to the Hansard website, which records every word spoken in parliament, you have never said "Afghan" or "Afghanistan" in parliament. Given that, how have you been putting pressure on the government?
Lisa Nandy[0:27:06] First of all, because this has largely been led by the Ministry of Defence. I'm the shadow Foreign Secretary not Defence Secretary. I've tabled a number of urgent questions to drag the Foreign Secretary to the House of Commons in order to answer questions about this, and they've never been granted. It in the government's gift how they control that. The only time that the Foreign Secretary has come to the chamber in order to make a statement about Afghanistan, it was in relation to aid cuts, and I don't shadow the aid brief, so one of my colleagues led for us on it, and led very well.
