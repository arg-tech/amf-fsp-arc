Theo Paphitis[0:28:12] Now, we need to focus a lot more and deal with category by category, industry by industry, age by age, requirement by requirement, it's hard work and you can't just make -- no disrespect to our politicians, Steve -- but the fact is, you know, the present Government do like to make big announcements for PR purposes. And we just need to do the graft and the work first and actually accept that sometimes it's going to be difficult, and sometimes you are going to say things that are not popular but you just want to be respected, not liked all the time, we must stop this wanting to be liked by the public. Let's get honest with them, tell them how it's going to be, and actually then address difficult issues that are going to be difficult, but if you show you're working at it, people will work with you on it.

George Mpanga[0:29:04] I express support for much of what Theo just said and much of what the panel has said. I do think self-employment, entrepreneurship, is going to be necessary moving forward as so much of our industry transforms. We're dealing with a new society. We go through it every time. We see someone, we think we're going to shake hands or embrace, we don't do these things any more, there is so much that we don't do any more. Look at the shape of this show. Now is the time for us to get creative about how we, as the incoming generation into the workforce, are going to reshape the economy
