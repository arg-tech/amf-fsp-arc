Fiona Bruce[0:17:48] Can I just ask because... Is there anyone here who thought Boris' speech was what the conference needed? That they thought it was the right thing? Hang on a second, I'm asking the audience, are you agreeing or shaking your head. No, you didn't. Nadhim, I need to come back to you. Now, we select our audience carefully on Question Time to be politically represented. The largest group voted Conservative here and yet this is what you're hearing.Nadhim Zahawi[0:18:16] And I opened by saying to Hassan that we have been through an incredibly difficult period...Fiona Bruce[0:18:24] Yes, but everyone knows that because they have lived through it. What they're asking for is something to happen and a plan.Nadhim Zahawi[0:18:30] If you let me finish the sentence. We've put 407 billion into protecting jobs. I talked about the furlough scheme which Minette talked about. £0.5 billion for this winter to help those families that you are all talking about. The warm homes discount is for 780,000 pensioners and families on low incomes which will give them £150 off their fuel bills.Fiona Bruce[0:19:00] Why do you think that's not cutting through to people? Because you can list the pollees, but people don't seem to be hearing it.Nadhim Zahawi[0:19:06] Your question was focused on the Prime Minister's speech.Fiona Bruce[0:19:08] It wasn't my question, it was from the audience.
