Willie Rennie[00:06:51] Well, what we need to do is to try and bring people together because we'll need the skills and talents of everyone in this country to get through this recovery. We won't do that if the country is divided by independence. And that's why I think it's most interesting that there are SNP supporters, and I've come across many of them, who are just sick to the back teeth of the divisions and they want to come together for a change. We can put aside our differences for the next five years to try and unite the country to get through this recovery; we owe it to these people to do exactly that.
