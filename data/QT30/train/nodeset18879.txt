As a teacher, you know, our curriculum changed and was reduced to become English heritage. And it’s not just about black history that needs to be learned, it’s about our history, our Anglocentric history warts and all, that needs to be learned from – but also needs to be put into learning now so that we don’t have each generations with similar attitudes that would just perpetuate this.
