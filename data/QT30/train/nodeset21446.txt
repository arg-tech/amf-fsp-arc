[FIONA BRUCE] : Lucy, let me come to you. What scientific advice should the government follow? We think about June 21. You heard what Anthony said, not a proper policy on test, trace, isolate, we are playing the same game time and again.
 
[LUCY FRAZER] : The scientific advice we should follow is the data. That's what we're going to do. We're going to look at the data on how the vaccinate programme is going, what new variants we have in the country, what is the hospitalisation number and the death rate.
 
[FIONA BRUCE] : What is it looking like for 21 June.
 
[LUCY FRAZER] : At the moment it is looking good, but we are going to continue to make that assessment in the coming days and up to 14 June when a decision will be made.
 
[FIONA BRUCE] : When it comes to Jenni's point about different scientists offering different points of view, as members of the public, what are we all supposed to make of it.
