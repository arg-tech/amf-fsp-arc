Fiona Bruce [00:52:14] Colette, you are nodding vigorously to that. [DONE][Colette]: There’s so much here. I completely align with Humphrey. I think this comes back to something Mark was saying as well. I’m in the hair and beauty sector. There’s a couple of things. We get the chancellor who goes on TV, with the offer of help, which is amazing, but the problem is we’re not seeing that come through. So in our sector we’ve been excluded from VAT cuts but yet we’ve been locked down as long as other sectors. Secondly, we have been promised grants from councils. A loft of these counsels are holding on to the money and it is not coming down to small businesses. I want to come back to something that Mark said. If you don’t look after your businesses and your employers, who are going to provide jobs? So this is the problem.We're kind of having such unfair treatment across all sectors. Not just that, devolved governments are getting more money than some businesses in England. It is disproportionate and unfair. I’m an accountant, by the way, as well as a hairdresser. The problem with that I see a really long COVID problem for employment when we are part of solution, not the problem. is I see a really, really, really, like Humphrey says, a long COVID problem for employment when we are part of solution, not the problem. We want to help but we can’t unless people give us a life lines we so need.
