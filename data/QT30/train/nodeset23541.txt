 [00:12:10] As someone who works in education, I feel like it was disrespectful for us to be the only ones in category one keyworkers that were not offered the vaccination. We were in hubs the entire time. We have gone back to full capacity since last August. Some of our staff still aren't vaccinated because of our age, despite the fact we are frontline, kind of. And the children I work with don't even have to be tested. Those children can be symptomatic and still come to nursery because they don't have to be tested. How is that protecting us?

[00:12:44] So you're talking about staff under 18 then, are you?

Audience Member 20211028QT08
 [00:12:48] Yeah, we have modern apprentices.

Fiona Bruce
[00:12:50] Right, I see what you mean. The man in the pink top.

And also teaching staff is a really important point. Teaching staff, so if we accept that part of the spike is related to schools going back and schools being hubs about spreading the virus, actually the teaching staff not getting rapid access to the booster programme and the second dose is part of the problem and puts greater risk on those frontline staff. So the lady is absolutely right and I hope England can learn from that mistake, now that their schools are going back, that we made here in Scotland.
