Fiona Bruce[0:53:14] This isn't a moment for you to do your thing about how marvelous you're doing in Manchester. Answer the question.
Andy Burnham[0:53:22] Well, can I say, am I allowed to say that I won every single ward in Greater Manchester?
Fiona Bruce[0:53:32] Bragging too far. Let's hear from the audience. Quite a few people with their hands up. Carlos.
AudienceMember 20210708QT14[0:53:40] Benjamin, this might be the first time you're not the only anarchist on the show. I wanted to say that I agree with Andy. I do think it is the Conservative Party promoting division amongst us, particularly amongst the working class that seem to have lost the pride in being. That's where the identity crisis is because it is associated with being poor and not wanting to be seen as being poor. But, unfortunately, the fact is that we still are. And the reason why the government, this Tory government use lots of systems and ideas that were socialist in this case is because they are actually good ideas. The NHS first in our care system. In an emergency they have become absolutely important just because these are great ideas.
