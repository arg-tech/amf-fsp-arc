Nigel Owens[00:08:45] So we need to listen to the experts and follow the advice on it and, look, I'm the same as everybody else, you know, the sooner things can get back to normal, the better it is for everybody, but I think we need to be very, very sensible in the way that we do that, and we have to really listen from the people that know best about it and follow the guidance that are in place to do that, I think.
