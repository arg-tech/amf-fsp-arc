Angela Haggerty[0:48:06] I'm not saying that's okay for that to be the situation, but we're in a crisis in an unprecedented time where I think the public would be far more likely to overlook that because the pandemic is what is at the forefront of everybody's mind now. [ DONE]
Ian Murray[0:48:28] It's not about the SNPs, Labour, the Tories. It is about the SNP seeking the truth.

Audience Member[0:48:40] Is the government doing enough to help assist the fishing and shellfish industries?

Fiona Bruce[0:49:12] The EU say this is the deal, you have to deal with it.
