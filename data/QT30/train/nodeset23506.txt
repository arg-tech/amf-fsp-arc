Paul Polman[1:05:38] In the US we have been very strong in rallying the CEO's together to rally when democracy was undermined on 6 January, when a President makes racial remarks, or whether there are remarks against communities. If we don't speak up against people that have these type of opinions that undermine the basic values of humanity, we move the boundaries in a very dangerous way. If you are a CEO of a company or in any position of power, society actually expects you to speak up. And this is difficult for some people. They tend to take the safe route or the easy way out or to keep silent. That's not acceptable, in my opinion, when it gets to these fundamental issues of dignity and respect, equity, compassion, that really are at the roots of making humanity function.
