Fiona Bruce[00:51:53] Jed?Jed Mercurio[00:51:55] I think Steve’s said so many important things there, and we’ve heard a lot of really great points as well. I’d like to maybe bring in a timely example, because there was a recent review which looked at the effects of COVID. And one of the troubling findings was about the vulnerability of certain ethnicities to coronavirus, specifically in terms of frontline healthcare staff. And I certainly think that an opportunity was missed to look at the risks that people are experiencing based on their ethnicity, and whether there should be redeployment of some staff, whether there should be changes in roles, and that should be factored in. As someone who’s still got a lot of friends who are in the medical profession, some of those are in those particularly vulnerable groups, I do worry that something should’ve been done, something…that review should’ve been acted upon and I can’t think of better example in terms of the time we’re at now.
