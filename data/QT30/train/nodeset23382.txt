[0:19:34] It is talking about very small numbers, and they are not getting particularly ill. But, yes, there is some evidence they can catch it.

Benjamin Zephaniah
[0:19:44] Lots of things start not particularly bad and get worse and worse and worse. We have to change our relationship with the environment, with animals, very quickly if we are going to live in a world -- we'll never live in a world free of viruses, but live in a world where we can meet, we can hug, we can party. All these simple things we take for granted.

Fiona Bruce
[0:20:10] Do you think you will be happy to do those things after 19 July? Like you arrived today with your mask, after July 19 can you see yourself feeling comfortable just living life as you did before or do you think --

Benjamin Zephaniah
[0:20:24] I'm pretty nervous and I have a gig on 19 July. Then I have my band booked for concerts in the summer, and I'm very nervous about it. In fact, when it started I remember they were talking about black men of a certain age who were very vulnerable. That was me. And I'm doing shows with young teenagers and they are spitting their poetry over me. This is very dangerous. We passed that, we've had various mutations, but I'm worried about what is going to happen in the future. When I hear you about coming back in September, I think, yeah, what do we know?

Fiona Bruce
[0:21:02] I feel the same. We don't know.
