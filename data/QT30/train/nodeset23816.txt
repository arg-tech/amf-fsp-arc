The numbers, the numbers are a joke, and the idea that 5,000 a year, even if you take all of them, and they come tomorrow, 20,000 turned up tomorrow, I saw some numbers earlier today been that's one in every four villages - one person in every four villages and towns in the UK. Clearly, we can take more. At the most simple analysis of the situation, we are a major player in the last 20 years of this situation. Therefore, we should take a major stance in the clean-up, and in the recovery, so we should not be looking at numbers, it should be our percentage of anyone that needs the help, and that should be probably be in the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even, and it sounds like not only especially when you take into consideration the numbers issued by the government today what it is going to cost for those 20,000, which I think was less than £1 billion, and take into perspective in the last 18 months, we can find £1 billion, we can find ten, especially something our mess in the last 20 years.
