Kate Forbes[00:06:51] The answer to Allan's original question is that the British Medical Association thinks that the answer is yes. With Sajid Javid talking about cases potentially rising to 100,000, now is the time to implement plan B. Now let's be clear what plan B is. Plan B is a lot of the things that are already in place in Scotland. It's things as basic as wearing masks in certain situations. Andrew has just alluded to the fact that he would support the wearing of masks, and I'm not one to tell UK Government what to do, but why on something as basic as wearing masks, it's not particularly onerous. It's not the most pleasant of things, but I'd far rather we saw an implementation of basic things like that than to resume restrictions. None of us want to see significant restrictions on our lives.
