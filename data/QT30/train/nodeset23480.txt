Fiona Bruce[0:22:20] We got a little bit away from the question. Paul, has Tory sleaze returned?Paul Polman[0:22:28] I am listening with interest. I am only privileged to what I read in the newspapers. But what is clear to me, it is an own goal that has been scored here. At a time when we need more trust in our politicians, in any institutions, at a time that we need to operate under a higher moral standard, I can only conclude that this is a human tragedy but also a political tragedy that should have some lessons. You cannot change the game when you are playing the game and that seems to be an attempt here to do that. That is very confusing for the public at large and I consider myself to be part of that public at large. There is a bigger issue here, though, that has been raised which I actually agree with that to what extent do we let other money come into politics to influence the decisions that need to be taken? In my book Net Positive that just came out, I specifically discussed the $3.5 billion that industry is using to lobby to influence laws. I have a problem with that. I think society at large has a problem with that. At Unilever I would not allow any of these things to happen, if I may be very clear.
