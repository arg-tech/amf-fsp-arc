[0:28:20] We were united in determination that something like that should never happen again! I just find it utterly bewildering that here we are four years later, and this still has not been resolved in a satisfactory way. The bill that has gone through Parliament has clearly been a hugely-missed opportunity. It's simply not fair for leaseholders through no fault of their own to be facing not only this great expense, but the ongoing fear of what might happen to them and their children, and their families should something horrific go wrong. This clearly needs fixing as soon as possible.

[0:28:58] My heart goes out to Natalie and the hundreds of thousands of people who will be disappointed by this news today and probably angry. I want to step-back a little about the fear Jo talked about. Up and down our country, there are people, hard working people, who are living in fear about their financial security, you know, we have carers, and we clapped our carers. Yet the majority of carers in this country are living in poverty. We haven't addressed child poverty and talked enough about free school meals. The issue after issue we are sleepwalking into a poverty crisis. One in five British people were living in poverty before this pandemic.
