Fiona Bruce [00:41:52] Alex?[DONE] [Alex]: I was going to mention Eat Out to Help Out. We should have spent the money making sure kids and the vulnerable in society had more. Every kid in the UK should have that, instead we spent on Eat Out to Help Out. Fiona Bruce [00:42:12] Susan. Susan Desouza? Susan Desouza [00:42:20] Can I just come in on that point about Eat Out to Help Out. Yes, schools are extremely important. It is incredibly important that children are able to learn. But we also have a hospitality industry and we have a live entertainment industry and those are things we should be very, very proud of in this country. We are just going to lose them. I took full advantage of Eat Out to Help Out. I think I ate at 22 restaurants in August alone. Fiona Bruce [00:42:48] Whoa! Hang on a minute. You single-handedly propped the whole thing up. Susan Desouza [00:42:54] Well, the first week I only went three times a week but by the second week I recognised I should go for lunch and dinner.
