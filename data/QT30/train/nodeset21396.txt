Fiona Bruce[00:35:45] Richard.Richard Walker[00:35:47] Yeah, it's a really interesting debate, this, because when you walk down the high street, and unfortunately for me there are many frozen pea purveyors and as a consumer you can go pretty much where you like. But if it's the water that comes out of your tap or indeed the train that I took from Crewe to Euston today you don't have that choice, and therefore perhaps surprisingly as a capitalist I'm actually all in favour of public ownership for monopolies. Now, if this is that I think that's a positive step forward, and I very much hope that it gives a better deal for consumers, not just in terms of price, which I know too well, but also in terms of service. So, yeah, I think it's a beneficial thing. But I'm repeatedly told by my dad – it was before my time – that National Rail was an absolute shambles. So nationalisation of trains isn't all it's cracked up to be.Fiona Bruce[00:36:49] You mean in the days of British Rail?Richard Walker[00:36:50] British Rail. So all I would say is that we properly fund this new facility so that as end consumers we get the best deal possible.
