[0:14:18] David, you had a lot of people -- not all, but most -- taking issue with you. Part of the question from Becky was, was Boris's non-action a missed opportunity to set the standard for social distancing. There has been a bit of comeback with the prime minister seen celebrating England's goals. But the guidance for outdoor events says everyone must be seated if they are consuming food and drink. There are a few people organising weddings saying he's doing that, why is he doing that?

[0:14:58] The worst example of that is the G7, with all of them clearly staged, then after that someone took a snap and they were all together. I agree with the fact you have to provide leadership by your action as well as by what you say. You know, as many of you may know, I have been fighting against some of the excessive limitations about this. But I don't disagree. That's why Hancock had to go. He had to go because -- I mean, all of us virtually on this Panel, by the sounds of it, and up and down the country, have had funerals, weddings, other episodes to deal with, which we have suffered.
