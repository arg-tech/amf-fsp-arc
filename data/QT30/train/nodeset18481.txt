Liz Saville-Roberts [00:40:24] And when the furlough scheme ceases, regardless of what Welsh Government says, because Welsh Government hasn’t got the means of funding their own policies, they are going to be facing the situation, and many, many other businesses, where they’ll be making redundancies this summer. This is the three winter scenario. Now, to come back to the question of public confidence, because at the heel of the hunt, it will be public confidence that changes this, we need an effective test and trace system in place, that is seen by people to work, both in Wales and in England, and until people have that confidence, then we’re going to see the same problem coming up. Alongside this, I beg both our governments, the Welsh government and the UK government, the English government in this respect, look at what’s happening to our tourism and hospitality industry, look at our dependants on this. These people will go out of business and there will be immense suffering in the terms of unemployment. Please do not pull the wool over our eyes. We need these industries into the future, and I fear what will happen this summer.
