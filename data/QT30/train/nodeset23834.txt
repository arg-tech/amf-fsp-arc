Fiona Bruce[0:48:58] The former head of MI5 said the Taliban will inspire and embolden more the wish to commit Jihad against the West. Rory Stewart, are we more or less secure now?
Rory Stewart[0:49:10] We're less secure. This is an immense victory for Jihadists, coming before the anniversary of 9/11, and we gave it to them - totally unnecessary, light presence, and we decided to hand this enormous victory to the Jihadists. President Biden believes by leaving he's ending the forever wars, ending the global war on terror. What he's just done is to to do something similar to what happened in Syria in 2013/14. He's probably extended this war on terror by another decade through a single unnecessary shameful betrayal of the Afghan people.
Fiona Bruce[0:49:42] Lisa Nandy?
Lisa Nandy[0:49:44] I agree with Rory that we are far less secure than we were even on Saturday, and that is a real problem. And I was surprised today in the House of Commons, when the Prime Minister made quite a lengthy statement to the House about our strategy, that this only warranted two sentences in his reply. It ought to be a priority.
