Fiona Bruce[00:36:09] Munira?
Munira Wilson[00:36:10] I can’t overstate how important getting test and trace right, and getting it right as quickly as possible is. Everybody who’s watching this evening is desperate to try and get back to some sense of normality. Without a robust operational test and trace system it’s impossible to be able to do that safely; we have to be able to find every case and isolate it and keep the…and suppress this virus.What is very clear to me is when I had a conversation with the Deputy Chief Medical Officer on 13th March it was around then that we stopped routinely testing and tracing every incidence of coronavirus. And I questioned her hard and I said why are you stopping the testing, we should be testing every case? And it was down to capacity, and it’s been far too late. It was some weeks after that that we suddenly saw a focus on ramping up testing. And, great, we’ve got the capacity but, James, we haven’t had for almost a month now the figures of how many people have actually been tested on a daily basis.
