Fiona Bruce [00:37:14] Alan? 
Alan Unknown[00:37:16] As somebody who has experienced the NHS in Wales who helped my son before COVID, I'd just like to say they deserve a lot more than what this country is giving them at the present. Clapping them and just saying that they're great, they deserve a lot more for what they actually do. 
Fiona Bruce[00:37:33] And do you think they should be made a special case? Claire's making the point that they shouldn't. 
Alan Unknown[00:37:38] I'm a limited company director myself who's received no help from the government whatsoever but I would treat them as a special case because they helped my son when he needed it. 
Fiona Bruce[00:37:47] Okay, Nigel. 
Nigel Owens[00:37:49] Yes, I think we mustn't forget as well the other people who are on the front line, who've put their lives at risk, who've spent time away from family and loved ones to look after and make sure that we can get on as much as we possibly can with our lives during these difficult times.
