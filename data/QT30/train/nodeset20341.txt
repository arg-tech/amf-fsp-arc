Fiona Bruce[0:53:42] Angela.Angela Haggerty[0:53:44] I think the fishing industry is probably more -- it feels deeply it has been sold out by the UK government when it comes to Brexit. People in the industry say they were quite often held up by the government as, you know, look at this industry, look at the support that we have for Brexit. And they expected a few things within that deal that they thought were going to be absolute givens. They might not get everything but they thought they were going to get some things. Then the deal comes along and they don't even get that. It has led to other problems. The people in those industries are kind of despondent. We're talking a minimum five years before anything could change, and even then it likely might not. I think it is appalling, the level of betrayal, actually, that has happened in that industry. We don't talk about that element of that enough, because it is quite important for those people in those communities.
