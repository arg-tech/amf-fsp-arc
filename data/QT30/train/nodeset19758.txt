Humphrey Cobbold [00:33:06] I run a commercial business, obviously, that relies on being opened and not locked down. So I’ve tried to keep our business as safe as possible for so long as possible. But I think Mark hit the nail on the head when he said that, you know, this new variant really changed the game. I think we need to move -- needed to move quicker to lockdown than we did move. Even now I would challenge us to say shouldn’t we be locked down even further. There are substantial parts of retail and other areas that still open that it is hard to regard as essential. I have nothing against those parts of retail, but the number one priority I heard reiterated by Rachel and other medics, I have a son, a 5th year medical student, we have talked about it at some length, if the number one priority when we get the vaccine programme up to that 3 million a week if we can, it is to limit transmission, then the lesson from around the world, I think, is we need to be prepared to lockdown really, really hard and pull together more in lockdown to limit those transmissions.
