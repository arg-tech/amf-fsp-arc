[0:08:40] When it comes to the poorest, I'm really clear, that's what I said.

Kate Andrews
[0:08:42] Well, I wonder about that, David, because when it comes to the poorest, I wonder if maybe there's an opportunity here for Conservative and Labour to come together and at least find a temporary solution to this issue. One of them could be that we need to lower the taper for universal credit. Rather than giving a 20 pound handout a week, we can lower the taper from 63p to 50p so that work really is paying more and more, so that when you're going to work, when you're coming home, you get to keep more of that benefit in the first place, and then maybe the Conservatives and Labour could come together and figure out where they're going to find that six billion pounds, as Grant says. Are you going to put a penny on income tax? Are you going to divert the tax that we're now going to be raising for health and social care, are you going to divert half of that? These are tough questions that we have to start answering, but perhaps we can actually care about those who are struggling the most at the bottom and come together on this one, at least for a temporary period of time, to figure out how we could solve this, and try to avoid that cliff edge, maybe even using the system as it exists now to change that taper.
