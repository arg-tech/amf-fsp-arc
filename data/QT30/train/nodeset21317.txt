Fiona Bruce[00:56:52] You heard it here, folks. And just briefly before we end, are you concerned that perhaps we are then going to be easing restrictions too quickly?Lisa Nandy[00:56:58] Look, I want to see restrictions eased as soon as possible, like everybody else, but I don't want to see us unravel the progress that we've made, and I want the country to move forward in step together. We had lots of confusing tier systems over the last year and I think what we've seen is that in the end that doesn't really work. We've got to make sure that we give people clarity.
