Lisa Nandy[00:53:05] It’s about having better legal representation. It’s about incomes as well. We were just talking about child poverty, but actually if you’re black you’re more likely to be poor, you’re more likely to be stopped by the police. There are real disparities in the immigration system as well. These are things that should be well known to any politician of any party, and the key thing now is that we get on and implement them. You can see why people are so frustrated.And I would just say this as well, my dad’s generation were amongst those who fought for greater racial equality in this country and they did make huge strides forward. And the way that they did it in the end was through leadership, people like Roy Jenkins, who stepped forward in order to bring in the Race Relations Act. Now, that was at a time when that was actually deeply controversial and pretty unpopular in Britain.What I would say to James is, I think that the government’s inaction is based on a very dim view of people in this country. Most people in this country now strongly believe that discrimination harms all of us even if we’re not directly affected by it – we care about one another, we’re a tolerant society. And the government really does need to get on and implement recommendations from those reports, not just kick this into the long grass, because if we’ve learned anything over the last few weeks, it just will not cut it any more.
