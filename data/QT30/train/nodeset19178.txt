Fiona Bruce[0:50:40]And from your personal knowledge of Donald Trump what’s driving his reaction to coronavirus? Is it, as many have said, purely electioneering, or is it something more than that?Anthony Scaramucci[0:50:52]It’s personality. I mean, he’s the most insecure person that you could ever meet in your life, Fiona, so he’s [reflexively contrary and if he has Jim inaudible 0:50:58] in front of him telling him what to do, he’ll do the opposite. If he has Anthony Fauci in front of him he’ll tell him to do the opposite. He’s insecure about having experts that make him feel inferior, and so he’s classically mishandling things. So I think that’s one of the more startling things about him, you think about his achievements. He ascended to the American presidency but yet he’s not somebody who can handle conversations intellectually with experts. He wants to run the American presidency as a one man West End or Broadway play. It’s nonsensical. And so there’s great frustration in the United States. He’s politicised the science, he’s lied to people about the science, and he’s right now as we’re speaking flying around the battleground states creating super-spreader events.Bonnie Greer[0:51:45]Super-spreader events.
