Fiona Bruce [00:12:30] Colette? 

[Colette]: My question is that, obviously, we’ve a lot of logistical issues. I’m very grateful to everybody who works in vaccines, my husband does. I think you do an amazing job. My question is we got quite a few issues and we can see what other bottlenecks are we going to hit. We have the problem of supply. What about vaccinating people and the concerns that GPs have and people signing up to become part of the vaccination programme and having to go through a lot of red tape to provide themselves to do the service? 

Fiona Bruce [00:13:08] Anneleise, a lot of concerns coming from our audience. It is worth pointing out, isn’t it, in terms of comparisons to the EU, the UK is doing well in terms of getting the vaccine out. 

[Speaker] We are. But this is a race against time, as Mark just sated. Ultimately it was in the UK that we saw the first licensing of this Pfeiffer vaccine. We had the Oxford vaccine developed in our country. We must be ambitious. That means saying that 2 million a week target has to be a starting point. We need to be moving forward much more quickly. We need to be open about where there are problems. I think Susan was actually saying there what many of us have heard that there have been logistical issues and government must be open about where they are. There’s a huge amount of goodwill. People want to help in this national effort to get as many people as possible vaccinated. But that means being open about where there are problems, where there are blockages, just like Colette said, where there are logistical issues with getting people signed up. I’ve had retired healthcare workers in my constituency saying they want to help but because of the administrative blockages they can’t get through. We had so many problems with test and trace. We can’t have a repeat of those issues now when we’re rolling out the vaccine.
