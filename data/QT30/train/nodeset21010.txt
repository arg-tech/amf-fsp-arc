Lorna Slater[00:23:55] Our turbine launched today, it was excellent, the largest turbine in the world launched today from Dundee, it's on its way to Orkney. And this is how we manage the decline of the oil and gas industry; to tackle the climate emergency, to meet our legal requirements under the Paris Agreement, the oil and gas industry must decline. 
But that does not mean that we have to inflict hardship upon the people who work in that industry. 

The Scottish Greens would see a jobs guarantee for all oil and gas workers, to make sure that they have jobs to move to in renewable industries, in other subsea industries. Scotland has 25 per cent of all of Europe's offshore renewable energy. We have a huge amount of potential there and I know that workers like yourself would be excited to work in a sustainable industry, an industry that has a long future, an industry that is on the cutting edge. And like with the turbine launch today, Scotland is on the cutting edge of renewables and we would welcome you to come and join our industry with us, and let's work together to build a sustainable future for Scotland.
