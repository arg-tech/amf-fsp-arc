[FIONA BRUCE] : Steve? [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Hi, everyone. She's the world number 2. This could be new to her. So suddenly it's a problem being accosted by the press. What happened when she was world number 3 or world No. 8? It is part of the job as has been said earlier. That's what goes with the territory. Okay, if she suddenly has a problem, mental health problem, yeah, I would have every sympathy with her. [FIONA BRUCE] : I'll point out Naomi has said she suffered long bouts of depression since Twain. She has had a hard time coping with that. She is 23 year old. Ryan, you asked the question. What's your view? [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Thanks, Fiona. Yeah, Naomi Osaka has been incredibly brave. She is only 23, a very young lady and she has been forced to take a lot of responsibility at an early age. But I think it extends to a wider point with mental health and other issues, sexism, racism, that people say you're going through something, to share that experience and to tell people your issues and your problems. Naomi has been brave and done that but when she has done that she has been lambasted and vilified by very many people. An unnamed popular journalist in the UK has been forthright in his views about her. So I think we should have more sympathy and patience and realise she is a human being.
