Fiona Bruce[0:18:20] Do you want to explain that? Question: Sean Bailey sent out Tweets about, in my view, trying to -- not my view, quite clearly -- trying to politicise this issue.
Fiona Bruce[0:18:30] Saying he would try to make the streets safer.
Dan Hodges[0:18:38] He is trying to have a broader debate but he's not. He's trying to win votes. You need to tell him to stop.
Mims Davies[0:18:48] I recognise that. Fiona asked what the government can do. We need to be reflective on that. But I do completely agree with Dan's point. This is very raw for a very -- one particular family. This is very raw and they don't really know what's happened to somebody who disappeared. I'm very mindful of that.
