AudienceMember 20210624QT24[0:38:24] But I think, you know, Daniel touched on something important here, there seems to be almost a pattern in behaviour of our larger institutions of feeling insulted, perhaps, being called "institutionally" something rather than taking the responsibility to get better. I would love an inquiry that led to a learning exercise rather than just another PR damage control exercise.Fiona Bruce[0:38:52] Sherrie?AudienceMember 20210624QT25[0:38:54] Isn't it mad to assume that the Met Police in general are corrupt? Surely, certain parts of the police are corrupt. You have certain people who are corrupt, it is hard to believe they are corrupt, but they are there. It's not the police in general, just a few bad apples within it.Fiona Bruce[0:39:20] I just want to come to you, Ian. This report is about the Met and makes it clear it is only talking about the Met. Talking to you in terms of the SNP in Scotland, a review found worrying evidence of treatment of black minority officers.Ian Blackford[0:39:46] The police need to take responsibility for what's happened here. You have to feel for the family, 34 years of being lied to before you get to the truth. It's not acceptable. Cressida Dick, as the Commissioner, has to accept responsibility as the presiding officers of the police service in London for that. I agree, Fiona, if we end up in a situation, whether in London, Scotland or elsewhere, that people don't have trust in our police force.
