AudienceMember 20210722QT27[0:44:14] So, this is really winding me right up. I'm really sorry. I'm very, really angry. It is not just about women! It's about men too. Men get raped. Men get sexually assaulted. So in this bill, don't just concentrate about women because men get raped too! And so do gay men as well. That's rife. This is what has been brushed under the carpet and it's wrong on so many levels so now the Government don't just concentrate on women getting raped, men get raped as well. And gay men get raped as well, and I have heard about it. My friends have had it. So, just look at the bigger picture, not just women! And, yes, sorry! That just got my goat.
Fiona Bruce[0:45:08] No, Dale you make a good point we hear you. It's true to say many more women get raped than me that is also true, not to deny the male experience, gay or straight.
AudienceMember 20210722QT28[0:45:20] Sorry women rape men. It's not just men that rape women. Domestic violence against men with women is high compared and obviously, men against women is high, but, domestic violence against man with a woman and the only difference is a man doesn't report it as much as a woman does.
