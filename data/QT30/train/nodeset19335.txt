Peter Openshaw [00:17:56] I think the MRHA is one of the most respected bodies internationally. They are extraordinarily careful in the way they scrutinise medicine to make sure they are safe. I have no worry at all about the way they scrutinised the data on the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. I think it is very, very important that medicines are properly regulated and we do have a proud record of it. I don’t think it has been affected by Brexit because this is a message regulation that has gone through all the due processes. I would be very happy, indeed, to be given this vaccine tomorrow if it was offered to me. [DONE]
Fiona Bruce [00:18:38] So I’m just wondering what you make of the responses that we’ve had today from the European Union, from Anthony Fauci, for example, who -- well, it is suggested they feel a bit stung by what has been said over here? 
Peter Openshaw [00:18:52] I think there is unfortunate international competition being set up. This is really us against the virus; it is not us against the Americans, us against the Europeans. We all ought to be pulling together to do everything we can to defeat this virus, and just speaking with one voice. I think it is very unfortunate, indeed, if we are trying to divide opinions on this matter. It is quite clear it has been very carefully scrutinised and I have no concerns about it. [DONE]
