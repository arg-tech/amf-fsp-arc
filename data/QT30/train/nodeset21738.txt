Fiona Bruce[0:31:02] Is that how you would like to see it go Madeline?

Madeline Grant[0:31:06] I don't think so. I want the old normal back. I don't want us to turn into China. I don't want to live in a surveillance state. I think that masks-- I agree with Chika that they are a smaller imposition than many, they may be needed for a while longer, but I don't want to accept a future of indefinite mask-wearing. If we are going to live with this in the way we live with the flu that means things like widespread inoculation giving people booster shots people who are affected should stay away from work places and schools. But if we are to regain a sense of normality and not fall into the pessimism that many of us are feeling both fear of going outside and doing things but a pessimism whether life is ever going to return to normal, we got so horribly used to that sensation of the goalposts moving and they moved so many times that we are playing rugby against the neighbouring rugby club not football any more. I'll believe it when I see it I think is the feeling. But to regain that sense of normality we need to scrap this obsession with testing kids in schools or devise a better system for dealing with children in schools. Right now there's entire year groups and classrooms are being sent home when one pupil tests positive. That is not sustainable
