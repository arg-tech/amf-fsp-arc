Fiona Bruce [00:25:44] Another question from Thomas Clark. 

[Thomas]: Deaths are still rising in our hospitals. In one day 1,800 recorded yesterday. Is this lockdown enough? 

Fiona Bruce [00:25:58] Louise. 

Louise Haigh [00:26:02] This week we learned that the UK has the highest death rate in the 7-day death rate in the world. That’s an absolute tragedy. That’s tens of thousands of families that have lost their loved ones. That’s not the fault of the dedicated nurses, carers and health care workers who have been risking their lives throughout this pandemic to protect ours. It is a result of the poor decision-making at the heart of this government. 10 months ago I came on this programme and I said if the government didn’t take action to increase statutory sick pay and make sure people could afford to self-isolate they would live to regret it and we would too. 10 monthslat advisers are still telling them self-isolation is not being it and they are still not taking action. It is over a year that testing measures were at the border. An effective public health response like test and trace are still not effective. So I’m afraid to say the measures that they’ve taken, the slowness going into lockdown and the speed they lifted some of these restrictions have caused voidable deaths. It was foreseeable and throughout this pandemic it has been completely foreseen.
