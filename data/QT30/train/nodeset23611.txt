Lisa Nandy[0:26:52] The National Farmers' Union has proposed a number of measures, including we have got temporary workers who are here and they're on temporary visas, they could switch to being able to work in the abattoirs but at the moment they have to go home in order to reapply, in order to come back and so the Government could take some steps right now that would ease the problem, but in the end, the only way that you fix this problem is to improve conditions in the industry. It is not necessarily about wages, it is not all about wages; it is about the conditions that people have to work in as well and this has been caused by a combination of factors, whether it is the global pandemic or the fact that we've had these changes to immigration rules. We've had 5 years to plan since Brexit and I don't care whether you voted leave or remain, I don't care if you didn't vote at all. Five years ago, this country took a decision that we were leaving the European Union. That means we've had 5 years under this government to plan. There should have been a taskforce to look at where the labour shortages would be. We should not be in a position where farmers are facing the prospect of having to slaughter perfectly well animals at a cost to the food supply chain simply because this government hasn't got a plan.
