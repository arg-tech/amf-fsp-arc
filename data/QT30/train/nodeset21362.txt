Fiona Bruce[00:01:24] Our first question tonight is from Sam Winter.

Sam Winter[0:01:29] Should we just abandon trips abroad?

Fiona Bruce[0:01:33] Should we abandon trips abroad? Are you planning to go abroad, Sam?

Sam Winter[0:01:37] No, personally I'm not. I'm quite happy being in our country. I've arranged a holiday but obviously local. No, this year I don't think I will personally go abroad. Maybe next year. I'd just like to see how things pan out for the rest of this year.

Fiona Bruce[0:01:54] Okay. We should be banning trips abroad according to Labour, Nick.
