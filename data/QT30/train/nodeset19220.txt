FIONA BRUCE [00:19:34] The head of the Covid force said only 15 percent would get a vaccine. This is before the Pfizer announcement was made pel. [DONE]
MATT HANCOCK [00:19:46] No, not necessarily. We learned more about the vaccine as time has gone on. The latest advice is we should go in the order I described and then to the under 50s, but not to children because this vaccine has not been tested on children, it is not designed for children and, anyway, children are very, very unlikely to get ill with coronavirus.[DONE] 
DAVID LAMMY [00:20:12] Two things. One, you didn’t mention Britain’s Black, Asian and minority ethnic which we know are dying disproportionally. There are other frontline workers, care workers and nurses. We can’t have one week the head of the vaccine task force say it is 15 percent, then a week later say, no. Is it less than 50 percent or more than 50 percent?
