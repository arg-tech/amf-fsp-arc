Fiona Bruce [00:10:54] You say a few weeks. We are three weeks in it. But in terms of the protocol and the differences it has made, the prime minister said in December there’s no question of there being checks on goods going Northern Ireland to Great Britain or Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Because if you look at what the deal is, we’re part of the same customs territory. No question of there being checks, yet, if you want to ship something like mince, for example, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you have to fill in an Entry Summary Declaration, a Simplified Frontier Declaration, a DVA mass goods reference, an export health certificate -- I could go on. There’s several other certificates here. If they are not checked, what are they?
