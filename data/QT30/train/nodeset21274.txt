Lisa Nandy[00:10:20] This is the sort of arrogance that will not serve you well.

Lisa Nandy[00:10:23] In 2019 the Prime Minister said he was level up this country. And then what has he done in this Queen's speech? He's broken his promise to fix the social care crisis. Who shoulders the loss of those promises the most? It's people in places like Hartlepool where the population is ageing, where they're at the sharp end of the social care crisis…
Fiona Bruce[00:10:41] Okay, I'm going to stop you.
Lisa Nandy[00:10:41] Break promise after promise and it will not serve you well.
Robert Buckland[00:10:42] We're listening to the public, you're just talking to yourselves.
Michelle Dewberry[00:10:46] Very briefly…
Fiona Bruce[00:10:48] No, Michelle, I'm sorry, just wait one second, because in this room we also listen to the public and there's lots of hands up in our audience, so I just want to hear and then I'll let you all come back in. And Kate, you're sitting there very calmly and quietly, I will come to you as well. Jo, you've got your hand up, let's hear from you.
