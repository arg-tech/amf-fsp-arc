Kay Unknown[00:46:00] I've recently tragically lost my own sister to a gaping hole in services and I think in Wales whatever, and the young people who are at the heart of decisions, that we should be building services around those people to support us, because they will be ultimately the carers and the engineers and they will be the builders of the future, and the NHS staff, and whoever the young people pick, I hope that they can see that they are deserving of a government that the framework is built for their wellbeing, that's physical and mental health, you know? And I sincerely hope that that is taken seriously by all parties. 
Fiona Bruce[00:46:38] Ian? 
Ian Unknown[00:46:41] Yes, I think the answer to the question is which party is most vocal about introducing it, because they've obviously done their research and they would know who is likely to vote for Labour, Conservative or Plaid so you've answered the question for yourself, really, that's what I think.
