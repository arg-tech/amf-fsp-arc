Angela Haggerty[0:32:28] We have a saying "with crisis comes opportunity". I think some politicians like Iain are not -- you want to talk about the SNP's domestic record. It's like the world is in flames and you want to talk about a tiny little part of it rather than see the bigger picture. Since 2014, we have now had Brexit, Scotland still does not want Brexit and we feel in Scotland as though that -- we talk about democracy, recognising the results of referendums, we feel that one hasn't been realised in Scotland. But also we now have COVID. This is a crisis that none of us saw coming. Sometimes, when you're in the middle of a situation like that, especially when the population seems to have high approval of how Nicola Sturgeon is dealing with this as opposed to Boris Johnson, what you then have is a population that could be looking at this and thinking, well, things probably can't get an awful lot worse than they are now so maybe this is just exactly the time to do it. We're in a crisis anyway, so let's take control of it for ourselves then we can build back up for ourselves. I think politicians are not quite getting this bigger picture. They are arguing about the smaller detail of it.
