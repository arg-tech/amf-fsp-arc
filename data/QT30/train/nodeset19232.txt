[00:30:22] No, people are coming forward to be 
vaccinated. Everybody participating. In the same way that with social 
distancing, that’s something we all need to do. Yes, absolutely, this is
 doable. I’m not saying it is easy, I’m not saying it will be 
straightforward. I’m just saying we have to do it and we will get it 
done.[DONE]

ROSIE JONES [00:30:46]
 It is up to you and the government to lead us and to give us the 
answers that we’re not getting. As a member of this country, a country 
that I love, I’m worried and scared because I’m not getting any answers. 

MATT HANCOCK [00:31:28]
 Ask the questions and we will try to answer them. One of the challenges
 of the pandemic is there are all sorts of questions that everybody 
wants an answer to. 


FIONA BRUCE [00:31:40] Let’s take some more questions from our audience. Donna. 

DONNA UNKNOWN [00:31:44]
 Thank you. A recent survey found that around 1 in 6 British people were
 unlikely to agree to being vaccinated against coronavirus. What, in 
your opinion, in the opinion of the panel, is the best way to reassure 
the public that the new Covid-19 vaccine will be both effective and 
safe?
