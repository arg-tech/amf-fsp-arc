Dan Hodges[0:34:38] Well, the point is they didn't name names, they didn't give a place, they didn't give a time.
Fiona Bruce[0:34:46] This is specifically you're talking about the conversation about Archy and concern about what colour skin?
Dan Hodges[0:34:52] Didn't give any sort of context. And they have branded, as I said, this institution, which is important to millions of people in this country, as racist without any evidence. If people are going to do that, fine, but then don't be surprised if in a couple of years' time you turn round and a new Nigel Farage has turned up or a new Donald Trump has turned up and they are exploiting this for their own purposes.
Bonnie Greer[0:35:26] Just to answer -- so much to say. Diane Abbot was on breakfast television in America this morning and she made a powerful intervention. People in America -- I don't watch French TV, but in my native land, you can talk about anybody, but people have no idea what's going on here. It has recalibrated their feeling about this country. I have been feeling like Erol Flynn for the last three nights on television defending this country's honour. That's how bad it is.
