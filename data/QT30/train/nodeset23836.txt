Fiona Bruce[0:51:54] Lisa Nandy, let Nelufar speak.Nelufar Hedayat[0:51:58] Everybody should be on the table. Ten days ago, the idea of talking to the Taliban was utterly unimaginable. Today, whether you want to do it via Qatar, or via the UAE, you have to directly or indirectly engage with them.Lisa Nandy[0:52:12] You're creating a division where none exist. This is one of the few areas where there is a cross-party consensus between us and the government. There has been an engagement with the Taliban for quite some time.Fiona Bruce[0:52:22] I need to let Mehdi in before the programme is over. Mehdi, are we more or less safe?Mehdi Hasan[0:52:28] To answer the question, we are less safe, but that's not because of the way the war ended, it's because of the failed war itself - 20 years of failures. James mentioned earlier we are safe after Afghanistan. We invaded Afghanistan in 2001, the 7/7 bombings happened in 2005, four years after our invasion. Terrorist groups have havens across the world, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, all countries we were militarily involved in in some shape or form. Rory mentioned earlier only six people died in Afghanistan in 2019 - he's talking about US troops. It was a horrific year for Afghan civilians. In the first year of 2019, first six months, the US allies killed more people than the Taliban. That is a shocking statistic. We killed more civilians than the Taliban. That does not act as a recruitment arrangement for terrorist groups? That doesn't embolden terrorism sitting in a Muslim country for 20 years, killing civilians intentionally or unintentionally? All the war on terror has given us is more war and more terror, and we need to change tack and stop indefinite occupations.
