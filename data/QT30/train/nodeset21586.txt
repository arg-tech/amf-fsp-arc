Fiona Bruce[0:13:26] Just to be clear, the moment the government is talking about an and people who could have the vaccine for medical reasons. They are not talking about visitors. None of this is clear yet. But other workers, workers, won't you tingles, yes, they would be expected to be vaccinated.
Fiona Bruce[0:13:46] I'm going on to another question. Nicola.
AudienceMember 20210624QT15[0:13:50] Should we be delaying Freedom Day for another four weeks?
Fiona Bruce[0:13:58] I'm going to come to you because I imagine you have fairly strong views in terms of this in the world of entertainment and theatre in particular.
Rosemary Squire
[0:14:10] Yes, and thank you for the question. Pre-pandemic in a year 34 million people go to live theatre, more than go to see premiership football matches. So these 24 months have been unimaginable for our industry. It is live, it is about the experience of all being together, sharing an experience. And the news earlier this week was devastating because it was contradictory to what we had been led to believe and, of course, theatres and productions can't just be rustled up overnight or in a week. It takes months to line up a major production which can be employing more than 100 people on a single show, to line that up, to have it ready for a specific date is really, really tough and it needs time.
