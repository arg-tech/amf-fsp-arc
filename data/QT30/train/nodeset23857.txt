Robert Jenrick[0:23:02] Having been to Hartlepool a couple of times over the course of the last few weeks, I'd say a few things. Firstly, there is a genuine desire for change. Having been represented for 57 years by a Labour MP, including prominent ones like Peter Mendelson. I did find people who want something different. They did look to people like Ben Houchen, the Conservative mayor, also up for re-election today, thinking they were doing a good job, there's investment, a free port, good jobs coming in, taking advantage of clean energy, the investment in town and high streets that we're doing in that part of the world. So they saw a positive change coming. I think, fundamentally, they didn't feel that the Labour Party today represented them. That is a real concern, I think, for Keir Starmer and for the Labour Party because they felt that it was now a party which was solely interested in the most metropolitan parts of the country and didn't speak to mainstream opinion in the rest of the country. That, I hope, we as the Conservatives are offering. I think that is a real challenge for the Labour Party.
