Andrew RT Davies[00:32:49] No, I think the First Minister will jump on any bandwagon that goes along, Adam Price. I would listen to the evidence and make the pay recommendation stick here in Wales that we could value our workers wherever they are, in the health sector or the care sector and not jump on the bandwagon. 

Fiona Bruce[00:33:03] Claire Fox.

Adam Price[00:33:04] What, supporting the unions is jumping on a bandwagon? You've got to listen to the workers that are actually delivering the care day in, day out, they are calling for this pay rise and you're saying you won't support it. 

Fiona Bruce[00:33:11] Adam, you've made your point. Claire Fox. 

Claire Fox[00:33:15] Adam, just even to reply to that quick point, there's an awful lot of workers in Wales who don't work in the NHS and an awful lot of them wouldn't want a pay rise. An awful lot of them would want to have some pay and some guaranteed employment.
