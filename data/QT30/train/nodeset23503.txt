Paul Scully[0:50:18] The net zero strategy that we launched two weeks ago is looking at seeking to leverage Â£90 billion worth of private money into developing all these kind of technologies and creating new markets which, incidentally, will create jobs and there's a business opportunity there. So that's when you get that perfect landing point, when you can actually -- instead of the kind of businesses that Emily was talking about exploiting people, can exploit things for the common good.

Fiona Bruce[0:50:54] How can people afford these? That's the question.

Emily Thornberry[0:50:58] I think it is a limp response. It is inadequate. Of course people need to be able to change. Most of us heat our homes through gas but also most of us don't have sufficient insulation. So it is all very well getting a heat pump, but if all the heat is going out the window anyway, we need to have both. Make sure homes are properly insulated, make sure we change the way in which we heat our homes. Quite frankly, I think it is a huge shame that over the last 10, 20 years there has been a change in policy, when I was in the department for energy and climate change, we had a policy of trying to make sure we insulated homes up and down the country. The government cut that scheme, introduced another one which has, frankly, been pathetic.
