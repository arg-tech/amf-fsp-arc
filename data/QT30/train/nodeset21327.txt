Fiona Bruce[00:48:17] But Michelle, the criticisms of this as a proposal is not so much that it would cost, because you're not suggesting it would cost, but it's just the time and effort required for people to go and get this ID and therefore it's a further barrier to them engaging in the democratic process.
Michelle Dewberry[00:48:30] Nonsense. If theyâ€¦let's just say if I said to someone now I've got a million pounds for you, you've won the lottery, a million pounds, but in order for you to get this money you've got to prove that you are who you say you are, I guarantee you not a single person is going to go, ooh, ooh, I can't really be bothered, it's a barrier for me to go and get my identification. I think it's quite insulting to say, ooh, it's going to be really difficult for someone who's an ethnic minority to vote if you make them have an ID card. And the point that I think it was Molly that raised about people being turned away, this is another caveat. If you're going to introduce a system, you need to learn the art of communication and make sure the people understand clearly what you take to vote with you, what will be accepted and what won't be accepted. And you have to trust that people are capable of following basic instructions.
