Fiona Bruce[0:50:20] Okay, but do you think -- this is a question about the NHS staff. Do they deserve more than a 1 percent pay rise?
Mims Davies[0:50:28] In an ideal world we would like to be remunerating everybody on the frontline of the pandemic more. We spent over 400 billion supporting people. I know from my own trust, transferring holiday for two years, buying back holiday, helping with mental health, having more nurses on the ward is really important, 60,000 in training. That's really important. The help through the furlough scheme, the business support, the VAT cut, all of that has helped people to keep their homes, support their livelihoods. Where partners have been affected by the aviation or tourism impact. That has been very -- in my patch where Gatwick has decimated the local economy.
Fiona Bruce[0:51:14] You're losing me slightly. I have to be honest. But in terms --(CROSS TALK)--
Mims Davies[0:51:26] The subject is that a million nurses are still benefitting from the 12 percent pay rise, also junior doctors. And the average pay is now around 34,000.
Fiona Bruce[0:51:36] The long and short of it is no.
