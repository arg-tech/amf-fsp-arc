Fiona Bruce [00:40:46] Josh, you have your hand up. [DONE]
[Josh]: So today in Parliament Gavin Williams said he would trust teachers to decide students’ grades, yet he won’t trust teachers to decide when they shouldn’t be in school. When people go for jobs there’s people on this Panel we’ve spoken to already that are vastly experienced, that’s the reason they are in that job. Gavin Williams is the most -- it is unbelievable how his experience lacks so vastly in this job. Someone as an education minister, I have to say I think he’s the worst that Britain has ever seen and I think it is time he left that post, effective immediately.[DONE] 
Fiona Bruce [00:41:28] James, you are nodding your head vigorously to that. 
[James]: I think it is woeful, the constant U turns. You know, this new variant was a surprise. The second wave wasn’t. To get kids in school one day, put teachers at risk, families at risk, then to pull them out the next. It is embarrassing, really. You’re right, Gavin Williams is pathetic. It is embarrassing.
