Paul Mason[00:21:35] You haven't won a seat in South Wales, in Llanelli.
Robert Buckland[00:21:37] I was a councillor in Llanelli, I was a Tory right, I actually broke through and won there and I represent a town now which is a working town in Swindon, I'm proud to represent it. This is the problem, people don't like being insulted. When you say that the Tories are a bunch of crooks and they're the upper classes and that they're monied classes, it's not only wrong, it's disrespectful. Learn some respect about politics and then people like Martin might give you an audience.
Fiona Bruce[00:22:02] Right, I'm going to…Paul, I'm sorry to cut you, but we're not going to get any other questions in unless I step in, so let's take a question now from Tim, Tim Down.
Tim Down[00:22:12] Hi, Fiona, panel. Does the SNP really have a mandate for a second independence referendum?
Fiona Bruce[00:22:20] I was going to come to you actually on this, Robert. I wonder why.
Robert Buckland[00:22:24] I think last time when the referendum was agreed, remember David Cameron, the Conservative government…
Fiona Bruce[00:22:31] Oh, I certainly do remember it, I think we all…
Robert Buckland[00:22:32] agreed to a referendum, there was a consensus actually in the Scottish Parliament and amongst the political parties. Everybody agreed, the Conservatives agreed, Labour agreed, everybody agreed within the Scottish Parliament that the time was ready for a referendum. And of course, we know what the result was. Now we're not in that position.
