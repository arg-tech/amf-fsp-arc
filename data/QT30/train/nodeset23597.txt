[0:22:38] Allowing the mass slaughter of pigs that won't go into our food chain, what's gone wrong with our food production?

Fiona Bruce
[0:22:48] The obvious person is you, Minette, as head of the National Farmers' Union and a farmer.

Minette Batters
[0:22:56] This has been a really difficult time. It has been heartbreaking. 18 months ago, farmers were the key workers, they are providing 60% of the country's food and the point was made about foodbanks and austerity and here we are, the first country in the world facing a cull of healthy livestock, potentially up to 120,000 pigs. These pigs are under contract so these farmers, this doesn't stop, this doesn't end. These farmers are producing under contract for processors and retailers and so...

Fiona Bruce
[0:23:32] When you say a cull, we won't be eating these pigs, they will be incinerated and that's the end of it.

Minette Batters
[0:23:40] They will have to be destroyed on farm, either using a bolt gun or lethal injection which is a massive issue for the vets in this country who are there to save lives, not to shoot or destroy healthy livestock. As far as I'm concerned, this is the start and it has to be resolved.
