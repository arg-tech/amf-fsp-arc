We saw the change in restrictions being announced about a week ago now, yet again we didn't hear what support was going to be available for those businesses that were affected. It is now, what, the fifth time that happens and a particular timeline given for them but no indication about what support is going to be available. Colette brought attention to the gaps that still exist, particularly self-employed people who have been left out. We need to recover from this crisis strongly. That means businesses like the ones we have been hearing from need to be supported so they can keep going, take extra people on, get the economy firing again, secure the recovery. That's what we need to see.
