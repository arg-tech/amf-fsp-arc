Fiona Bruce[0:48:50] Would you be happy to settle for 1 percent?
AudienceMember 20210318QT25[0:48:52] Yes. I think the money -- I think we all have to share the pain. To me a 1 percent pay rise is acceptable pain, if that's the right word, considering the pain that others in society have to suffer. So, yes, I do think that we should accept that and accept that for the greater societal good and accept that other people apart from NHS staff are also suffering through the pandemic and also deserve something.
Fiona Bruce[0:49:28] Mims, this must be music to your ears. The prime minister seems to be softening us up to see what the independent peer review body says.
Mims Davies[0:49:40] Absolutely. As employment minister, at DWP where we had more people coming to be part of DWP from sectors that we never would have imagined would be applying for universal credit. One figure that sticks in my mind of our staff, 27,000 extra hours worked over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend to get people paid and supported because the handbrake on the economy of the pandemic coming down on them, a massive shock to the system. But of course it is NHS, our teachers, who have continued to be on the frontline.
