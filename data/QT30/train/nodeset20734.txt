AudienceMember 20210318QT05[0:07:22] I would like to say to Sara's family and anybody who has lost someone tragically -- at the moment it is a disappearance, unexplained -- they are waiting for news. This is absolutely horrendous. We know it happened to too many families. I think Becky is right, we are fed up with it.Fiona Bruce[0:07:40] Realistically, what can people do?AudienceMember 20210318QT06[0:07:46] Cressida Dick was right to say this is rare in terms of something happening and reassuring this is taken seriously as the statement, today, of course, from the Home Secretary Priti Patel. Our safeguarding minister to Bonnie's point is Victoria Atkins. She is determined to protect women. And there's a bill going through The House at the moment which is focused on domestic violence, making sure women are safe in their homes. My local council has more money. I'm pleased about this. It is an opportunity for a refuge, moving women forward.
