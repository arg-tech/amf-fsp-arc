Ryan Unknown [00:12:50] I think it's now the SNP's proposals are now saying they're going to wait now until 2023. You know, at least Alex Salmond in the Alba Party are saying they're going to just get on with it, they'd like to do one just straight after the election. I mean, I would actually…I'd prefer none of it but I'd go with that approach, it seems to be the better one to do. But I just think that's a simple choice – recovery, or debate stuff that we've already been debating for the last few years. 
And I just really don't see how this is going to change anything. I think we need a change in politics. I'd like to see a government of national unity working with each other and actually putting these old divisions aside and actually doing what's best for the country.
Fiona Bruce [00:13:30] Well, we've only been on air for about ten minutes but by the looks of it there's scant chance of that from what I can see here.
Keith Brown [00:13:34] But there is a chance of that.
