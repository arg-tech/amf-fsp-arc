Fiona Bruce[00:43:15] I mean, James, I just had a little look through the number of reviews that there have been, and by my counting anyway there have been eight reviews in the last three years looking into race or the effect of race as part of a bigger project – why do you need another one?
James Cleverly[00:43:29] Well, reviews are how governments learn about what needs to change or needs to…
Fiona Bruce[00:43:34] Well, these are…most of these are your government reviews, there’ve been eight in the last three years.
James Cleverly[00:43:39] Yeah, look, I’m not…I’m not going to suggest that the government should stop learning and stop understanding, so I’m comfortable with reviews. And actually I’m very proud of the fact that I’m part of a government that has made some real differences. So, for example, and I know these figures will now be distorted because of the situation with the coronavirus, but up until that point, the increase in employment had disproportionately benefitted people from black and other minority groups. And having a job, I think we’ll all agree, is a foundation stone for a better life.
