Fiona Bruce[0:21:18] Are these people contacting you trying to get out?
Rory Stewart[0:21:22] Absolutely. I'm sure, my phone, and I'm sure everybody else here, is teeming with literally thousands of people coming through different methods trying to get out. People are genuinely terrified. At the moment, you cannot get to the airport. There are Taliban checkpoints all the way to the airport. The military won't let you in. The conditions set by the US and the UK are very narrow, and above all, the answer to this million international -- what the UK should be doing is working with other partners to share the burden. More than 40 countries were involved. If we share the burden, we can do this. It was done for the South Vietnamese boat people. It can be done for Afghanistan, but it cannot be done by individual countries offering 5,000 a year. [Applause].
Nelufar Hedayat[0:22:06] There is a lot of talk of nation-building, and we think it's like a Lego system that we can pick up from Britain and implement in Afghanistan, like we thought with the military system, like we thought with this idea of governance, or giving -- forcing democracy down the throat of every Afghan, whether they wanted it or not. Nation-building by Afghans for Afghans is what all of you should be thinking about. [Applause].
