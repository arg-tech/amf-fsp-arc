Fiona Bruce[0:25:46] In terms of the question, should that mean Keir Starmer should go?John Bercow[0:25:52] No. There are two reasons why it is not such a great surprise. The first is that we've had a suspension of normal politics for the 13 months of Keir Starmer's leadership and, indeed, a few days before. In December 2019 people said they wanted to get Brexit done, and the government has delivered on the first phase of Brexit. I happen to think it is the most colossal foreign Policy blunder in the post-war period, but people voted for it. In a sense it would counterintuitive if voters said we know we wanted that in significant numbers, even in Hartlepool, where Brexit party is not standing this time, but actually we're going to punish the government that delivered what we said we wanted them to deliver. I think you have to allow for the fact, consistent with the fact of suspension of normal politics, there is a wave of relief in the country at the arrival and, yes, the effective distribution of the vaccine and a desire to reward the government. Now the distribution is overwhelmingly about the NHS and the devising of the vaccine is overwhelmingly about the quality of scientists and little to do with the government. Nevertheless, it has been a success. In light of the two factors there should be such a turn of opinion in a short period.
