Fiona Bruce[0:52:32] What should happen now?
Daisy Cooper[0:52:34] Before Christmas I co-ordinated a group of 40 MPs on a cross-party basis to ask the Government to change two or three things. First of all what carers were asking for, why was it OK for paid carers to be going in but not for family carers to be going in and out, we asked for family members to be designated as the specific carer and to get access to the same level of testing that the paid carers were getting. I think what is really important in cases where you have mentioned people who have dementia for example, their decline has been so rapid without that family contact, but this is about the balance of harms. So, we do need to see measures in place to allow carers to see people otherwise they are going to die of neglect rather than dying of Covid. It is unbearable for those people and for their carers. We need to see that acceleration, and care homes themselves are asking for protection like the hospitals have, like the NHS has, if there's, so she have got the insurance.
