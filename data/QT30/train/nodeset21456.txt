Fiona Bruce[0:24:02] All right. Let's hear from some other people too. Will. [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Maybe slightly unpopular, I think we should extend the deadline. We have a solution and its the vaccine. Why should we put more people at risk, 130,000-odd dead already, why put more at risk for the sake of potentially a few more weeks.Fiona Bruce[0:24:24] Tony.AudienceMember 20210610QT04[0:24:24] Good evening. I get the impression that Anthony wants to have his cake and eat it. On the one hand he is saying we should maintain a lockdown, then he says in the Far East they manage to continue to boom without a lockdown. So I'm as confused as Jenni. I thought that the vaccination programme was going really, really well. I thought we were on top of this and getting better by the day. Now we're told that, well, this is going to go on forever. At some point we've really got to regain our lives. Yes, we should have learned from what happened in Vietnam. Yes, we should have been wearing face masks much earlier, but I remember early in the lockdowns the scientists were poo-pooing masks saying this disease is transmitted by touch. So the advice just keeps changing. I wish all these people would get together, work out, learn from what others have been doing. We haven't done well but we haven't done as badly as some other countries. Let's move forward, get the population vaccinated, get out of it and move forward with sensible ideas that will allow us to regain our lives.
