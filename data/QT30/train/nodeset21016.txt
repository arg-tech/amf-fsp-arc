Fiona Bruce[00:26:00] Okay. Are you also going to pledge them to phase out fossil fuels within ten years?
Keith Brown[00:26:05] No, I think, to go back to Alan's question, back in 2013-14 when there was a real crisis in the oil and gas sector in Scotland, with a plummeting price, we instituted a number of revisions which allowed people to train out of those jobs into other jobs for that period.

Keith Brown[00:26:34] Well, I do think it's very important that we should explore other avenues as well, so for example, carbon capture twice could've been started by the UK government and they pulled the plug on it.
