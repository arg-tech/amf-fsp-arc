Fiona Bruce [00:32:12] George? [George]: There’s loads of people out there at the moment who are furloughed and being paid to stay at home, yet they are going out taking second jobs, things like that, which is obviously spreading the virus around as well. I think people who actually flout the law, I think really should be basically made to pay back their furlough payments and fined. Because its -- you go to the supermarket, things like that, there’s people refusing to wear masks and other people just literally disrespecting what everybody is trying to do. You know, disrespecting the NHS, disrespecting what the whole country is trying to do. It is really, really frustrating. I think, anyway. [DONE]Fiona Bruce [00:33:06] Humphrey.
