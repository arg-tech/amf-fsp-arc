[0:09:18] I think the message has to go out loud and clear that this isn't some sort of jolly. It should be very much a focused event. Come on Robert. It shouldn't be a jolly. Going to a footy match. Look I get the point, I get the point and anything sounding like watching a football match sounds like a jolly

Caroline Lucas
[0:09:38] Yes. Robert.

Robert Buckland
[0:09:42] If it is curtailed it is doable. I accept these are very difficult moments for all of us. I don't pretend this is easy, and there will be other occasions people will say hold on, why does it seem so contradictory, that's where we are at towards the end stages of this common endeavour, and I accept that there will be difficulties like this.

[0:10:00] I don't think Robert really believes what he is saying! It doesn't stack up frankly this stinks as Dale said, it stinks. It is deep hypocrisy. You know, it's Barnard Castle all over again. That means it's dangerous too. At that point people lost confidence in what they were being asked to do, everyone has made such huge sacrifices and they have seen that thrown back in their faces back then with Cummings going to the castle and then the Government putting out the red carpet. It's dangerous because it undermines confidence in the measures.
