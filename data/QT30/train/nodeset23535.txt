Fiona Bruce[00:18:00] Right, well, I'm sorry to hear that you feel more unsafe because that is not a position anyone or any woman wants to be in or to feel. Heather, I'm asking you obviously in terms of your role at Heriot-Watt University, when you hear someone like Ingrid saying something like this.Heather McGregor[00:18:13] I know. Ingrid, I really feel for you and nobody, as Fiona just said, nobody should feel like that. Fiona Bruce[00:18:21]But what can be done? I mean, that's the question.Heather McGregor[00:18:23] Yeah, and what can be done about it? Well, first of all, this is happening in clubs mainly. It's happening in big nightclubs, in crowded clubs, and I think that the venue owners and the venue managers should have a duty of care towards their customers. And I applaud the people that are boycotting some of these places because of this, because they haven't got a duty of care. Now I have thousands of young people under my care and we have a duty of care towards them.
