Fiona Bruce[00:22:02] Sarah?Sarah Unknown[00:22:04] Yes, I think there is a bit of a concern that all the good work that we've done and the trust in AstraZeneca that we've been given could be kind of undermined if the supply chain gets broken. I mean, I'm really hopeful that the discussions held between the Prime Minister and the EU yesterday will facilitate some resolution but, you know, sometimes the EU have not always held their end and we've noticed that in Brexit about the negotiations breaking down, so how much confidence can we have in those negotiations? Fiona Bruce[00:22:36] Camilla?Camilla Unknown[00:22:39] We've bought far more vaccines than we actually need and it seems very dog in the manger-ish not to be sharing it and not to be sending it abroad, and the rate limiting factor for our vaccination programme is physical giving of the vaccines day by day. We have far more vaccines than we actually need.
