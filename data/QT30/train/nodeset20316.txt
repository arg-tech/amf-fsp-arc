Fiona Bruce[0:26:12] Stephen, give us your perspective.

Stephen Fitzpatrick [0:26:16] I used to live in Edinburgh, about a mile away from here, I spent some of the happiest days of my life right here. It would make me incredibly sad to think of Scotland as an independent country. I understand as an entrepreneur and somebody who didn't want to report to somebody else, I understand the urge to find independence. When I think of Scotland, I think of the potential of an independent Scottish nation, I have no doubt whatsoever that Scotland could be a thriving independent country, with an exciting future. But I have to say, you ask any entrepreneur what happens when you quit your job and you set off on your own. Anybody who tells you it is going to be easier or better, you are going to be better off, that you're going to have even more independence, I can tell you it is not true. As an entrepreneur you sacrifice so much, work twice as hard to get half as much. You risk losing everything. It takes a long time for that to pay off. If this is the path Scotland wants to go down, I can understand both sides of the argument, but if anybody tells you it is going to be easy or better or you are going to have more independence, I can tell you there's a lot of other problems that come.
