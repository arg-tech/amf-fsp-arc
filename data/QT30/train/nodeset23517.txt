[0:45:20] Yes, we need to have proper commitments from countries where they mean it and whenever we have international meetings we sit down and say how is your plan? How are you getting on with it and people are held to account. Yes, we need to spread responsibility to other companies. It may be that British companies in Britain or perhaps Dutch companies, you know, when they are working in places where there's a lot of regulation, where there's a good media, they may be behaving in a way that they can hold their heads up high, but some of those companies are behaving well once they get out of Europe, away from the media, where there are governments that can't or don't regulate or whatever it is, and those companies in those countries are behaving in a blatantly irresponsible way. What we need to do is be looking carefully at our supply chains, regulate them properly, have a proper vision so we can keep control over the way some companies are behaving around the world.

[0:46:20] Paul Polman, let me come back to you. You're not head of Unilever anymore but I know you talked a lot about corporate responsibility. What is your view about some companies not living up to it?

Paul Polman
[0:46:34] I agree. We are all in this together. The secretary general called It Code Red. We have to all have a long discussion if these commitments are serious or not, but we agreed on a review of that now every two years, the emerging markets are asking for an annual review. I happen to agree with that.
