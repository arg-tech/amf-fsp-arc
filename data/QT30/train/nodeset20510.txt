Fiona Bruce[0:37:02] You have doctors wearing bin liners and ski goggles, you have the Royal Head of Nursing saying this is deeply insulting, nurses were put in harm's way because they couldn't access proper protection. You have doctors' association applying because they didn't have enough. Are you saying he is right, that there wasn't a national shortage of PPE?Grant Shapps[0:37:28] Let me answer the question and get the whole thing out. First of all, the entire world was scrambling to get PPE.Fiona Bruce[0:37:34] We know that.Grant Shapps[0:37:36] Let me finish the point. We didn't have a domestic manufacturing base for this country in PPE. Now we are producing 70 per cent of the PPE right here. We delivered 32 billion pieces of PPE. Were we having to work very hard.Fiona Bruce[0:37:52] No, the question is was Matt Hancock right that there never was a national PPE shortage? That's the question.
