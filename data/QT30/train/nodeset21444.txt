[0:06:30] Thank you. I'm quite shocked at what I'm hearing. Do we not think this generation has been failed enough? As an employer we're talking about students coming out -- you just said about coming out going to the employment market. You know, we can't fail this generation any more that's already been failed. They are going to be left with the tax bill of this and we owe it to them to put in the right amount of money. This will not fill that education gap for any schoolchildren or anybody in further education or anything else.
 
[FIONA BRUCE] : Fatima?
 
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] : So the extra funding is for tutoring the children who need it the most but what about in those schools and areas where the children who need it the most are the majority of the children? How are the teachers supposed to choose which of their students they support and which they leave to fend tore themselves. There isn't enough money to support everybody.
