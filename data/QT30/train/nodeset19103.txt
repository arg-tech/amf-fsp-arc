Fiona Bruce [00:52:04] Can I just get the rest of the panel. We’re beginning to run out of time. Seema, the question is how long can the UK government continue denying the Scottish to have have a say. If Keir Starmer was prime minister would he give them that right? 

Seema Malhotra [00:52:22] We said we will be going into the next Scottish elections opposed to a referendum and independence. I think it comes back to the point that we’re in the middle of a pandemic. It is very surprising to me that Kate talked about investment and she talked about the polling data, but I’m surprised she didn’t mention, for example, that the child poverty figures out today show that child poverty in Scotland is at 24 percent and rising and rising as well in Nicola Sturgeon’s own constituency, in Glasgow. I think we’re missing the point about what we should be really focused on. People’s health, jobs, the economy, education. Children this year who have seen a disrupted education, it is not going to magically correct itself next year. Look, I just feel that the last thing people are going to want is another divisive referendum when there is such important issues to focus on just to rebuild a health system with our NHS currently under strain, with a lot more to come, our economy with jobs possible not back to pre-Covid levels for 2 or 3 years. With the education, retraining, with older people losing their jobs and catching up with younger people. I think these are the critical issues. That’s why the Scottish Labour Party has been focusing on these issues. That’s what they will want to be talking about. This is where so much of the polling also shows that people’s priorities are across the United Kingdom
