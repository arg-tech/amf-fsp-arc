Fiona Bruce[0:30:50] When you say the first four million do you mean to the age of 50? Sooner?
Daisy Cooper[0:30:54] The first four million which was the first four or five cohorts. We are way beyond that now. The situation we have is that none of us are safe until all of us are safe! For as long as people in India cannot get the vaccine, not only will loads of people die but it also means that the virus will mutate again and that will turn up into other strains that will wash-up on our shores. It is both the morally right thing to do, and also a self-interested thing to do to make sure that we get this parallel roll-out. Norway is doing it, the US is sending vaccines but at the moment the UK Government has not yet committed to sending vaccines to India.
Fiona Bruce[0:31:34] The US is sending vaccines it's not using.
Daisy Cooper[0:31:36] We need lots of countries to be sending vaccines to India. What we think the Liberal Democrats think, is that the Government should be enrolling on this parallel roll-out of the vaccine. We know that with all the vaccines that have been ordered, we have a surplus in the UK, and so we could actually embark on this parallel roll-out where we are vaccinating our own population whilst also senning some vaccines through the Kofax international scheme as well. As I say it's morally the right thing to do and it's self-interested. For as long as we don't vaccinate people, they will die and the virus will mutate and wash up on our shores.
