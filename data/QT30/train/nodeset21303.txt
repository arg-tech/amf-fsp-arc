Chris Unknown[00:29:00] If you want to have a referendum, an indicative referendum to suggest that there should be a real referendum on Scottish independence, shouldn't we actually be looking at whether Scottish independence is actually viable? I could decide that our village ought to go independent and put a man on the moon, doesn't mean I can do it. And I don't think that anybody is really looking at whether or not there is a way in which Scotland can afford to fund itself. Is it going to be allowed to join the EU? Is it going to be able to manage its own affairs in the way it thinks it's going to be able to? Nicola Sturgeon has complained so much about having a border down the middle of the North Seaâ€¦sorry, down the middle of the Irish Sea, but she wants to put one right across the mainland of the United Kingdom.
Fiona Bruce[00:29:59] Paul.
Paul Mason[00:30:00] I think the short answer is yes, there is a mandate for a referendum. It would obviously be sensible for that not to be soon. But to the people who are intensely interested in whether the Scots can go independent or not, it's not your business. Under international law nations have the right to self-determination. That is not just international law, it was recognised when David Cameron said to the Scots, if you vote for independence you get in independence. It's why Ireland, by the way, is independent and not part of the United Kingdom.
