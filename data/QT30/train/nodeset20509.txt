Grant Shapps[0:33:00] Let's talk about the future. We have over a third of the population vaccinated now. It is a real question. All the points raised have been very good. When you open it up it is a can of worms. It is moral, ethical issues, practicalities, which is why we set up the task force to look at it. We expect if government is not involved, not having the discussion, businesses would try to go off and do their own things. What happens to somebody who, for medical reasons, can't have it, to younger people who won't get this for a while, to children -- the vaccine has not even been trialed on children yet, so are we saying they can't access those services? It is true to say this needs to be about testing as well as vaccines. Then, of course, how does it work for international travel? I'm running a separate task force on international global travel task force to work out what we do there. When we travel internationally to certain countries you have to show a yellow fever card. So there are precedents for this. It is a minefield.
