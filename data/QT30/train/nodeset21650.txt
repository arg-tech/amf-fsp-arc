Fiona Bruce[0:25:34] Chika, what do you think society is going to look like without restrictions or will there still be some restrictions as we go forward? What would you like to see happen?Madeline Grant[0:25:44] I think that we need to maintain some restrictions because we -- you know, we cannot afford to go back.Fiona Bruce[0:25:54] So what kind of things are you thinking?Madeline Grant[0:25:58] Masks, for instance, are a small imposition. I think we should remain wearing masks.Fiona Bruce[0:26:04] What about schools? One in 20 are off school at the moment, certainly in England at least because of COVID.Madeline Grant[0:26:10] That's the reason why we really need to maintain some of the restrictions. Because schools and the children have suffered so much and continue to suffer. We speak about this disparity. There's huge disparity between, you know, children who are from kind of less privileged socio-economic backgrounds that have missed a year plus of education. You know, if we are going to be living with this new normal, and of course, you know, as David mentioned, at some point eventually we will go back to a more normal norm where, living with the flu, there are no more school closures, but we have to be on the front foot because we don't know what's coming. We know to expect the unexpected and we do know at some point something is going to come up again.
