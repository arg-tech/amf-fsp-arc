Ian Blackford [0:47:10] One of the real ironies of this is the government negotiated a deal where people can go and work in Australia. They are going to be sending people from the UK to Australia to work on farms to put our farmers out of business. That's what this government has done. It is madness on stilts. We have a situation that Brexit was about taking back control. We sold out our fishermen and we are just about to sell out our farmers.
Fiona Bruce[0:47:36] We are finding out details from Dan bra but not finding out details here. Why is that happening.
Mark Harper[0:47:44] The government has set out the jut line and it will have to be voted on in Parliament. I think this is a good deal -- it is worth saying that we've just done a deal with the US to deal with tariffs on Scotch whisky which is fantastic news for Scotland, a double win for Scotland. But this is about opening up opportunities for British businesses and British farmers to be able to sell into markets overseas as well.
