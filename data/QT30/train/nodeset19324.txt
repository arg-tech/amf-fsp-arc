Fiona Bruce [00:27:16] Right. Tom, I’m going to come to you first. Tom Kerridge [00:27:20] Hospitality is being -- like Mathew was saying -- has been hugely exposed through all of this pandemic. The industry that has been at the frontline as well as travel, tourism, aviation, they’ve all been hit massively but from my point of view hospitality is under a huge amount of pressure right now. We’re able to open 200 yards away from Mathew, but you’re not now. All these contradictory questions. The problem that you come across is so many pubs, so many restaurants, so many hotels have spent so much money over a period of time being able to reopen, reinvest, try to make themselves Covid-secure, trying to make sure health and safety is being adhered to, risk assessments done, PE, social distancing, so we get through that first lockdown period where, to be fair to the government, the furlough scheme that Matthew is on has been helpful from a staffing point of view, but moving forward to open within the industry it needs much more help. There are pubs closed now losing thousands upon thousands of pounds.
