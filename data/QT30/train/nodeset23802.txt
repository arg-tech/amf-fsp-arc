Fiona Bruce[0:05:44] Rita, let me come to you.
Lisa Nandy[0:05:50] I think first to acknowledge that the entry strategy was flawed as well. It was absolutely right, as James said, after the 9/11 attacks, for the UK to want to respect that Article 5 of the NATO Agreement had been invoked, that we have a duty to come to the mutual aid of NATO member states that British citizens have been some of the second biggest victims of the 9/11 attacks outside of the United States, and that there was a real need to degrade the capability of Al-Qaeda, but those decisions were flawed in that there was no real understanding of the complexity of what then had to come next, and so this has long and deep roots. There have been a series of political and strategic failures over a very long period of time that led to here. To answer your question ...
Nelufar Hedayat[0:06:40] Both on the left and the right, that is really important to mention.
Lisa Nandy[0:06:44] And both sides of the Atlantic, I accept that, and it's really important to have a level of humility about that.
Fiona Bruce[0:06:50] What are Labour's failings in this issue?
Lisa Nandy[0:06:54] The decision to go in in the first place was taken when George Bush was in power on one side of the Atlantic and Labour was in power on the other. There are lessons that we are going to have to learn about the last 20 years in Afghanistan. We should not shy away from learning those lessons about the role that my party played, just as we should not shy away from learning the lessons that James' party has played as well.
