Douglas Ross[00:16:25] Scotland was once a world leader, it's now internationally average for education. And all these things we can do if we don't have the threat of a referendum hanging over us. And I'd just say to Keith, what do you think, tonight, listening to Emma, as a former SNP voter, saying the SNP are only focused on another independence referendum? That's after 14 years you've been in power – you're offering nothing new to the people of Scotland other than more division with another referendum.Keith Brown[00:16:53] Absolutely untrue [voices overlap16:54].Douglas Ross[00:16:54] But that's what Emma's saying.Keith Brown[00:16:56] If I can just answer the question, Douglas. If Emma would like to look at the manifesto, she'll see there is a mention, of course, of the referendum because we do think it's crucial to how we actually get through the pandemic. But the national care service, the increased funding for the NHS, the baby box continuing, the fact that we're going to have free school males for every child…and breakfasts and lunches for every child in primary school. There's a whole host of other stuff in there.
