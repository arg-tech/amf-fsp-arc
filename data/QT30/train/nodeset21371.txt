Fiona Bruce[00:10:53] Right. Just to ask, who here has booked a holiday abroad this summer? Richard, where are you intending to go, if you're allowed?
Richard Walker[00:11:01] Well, this sounds very confusing for a guy from Iceland to say, but I'm going to Greenland.
Fiona Bruce[00:11:06] Right. Okay. So you don't think we should be abandoning trips abroad then. Clearly not.
Richard Walker[00:11:09] Well, in answer to Sam's question, I don't actually know, to be honest, I'm a bit confused. Either we're trusted to make our own decisions or we're not, and if we're not it should be red or green, legal or not legal. I think what we need to doâ€¦
Fiona Bruce[00:11:23] So you think having the amber light is confusing.
Richard Walker[00:11:24] Yes. I think we're either trusted to make our own decisions or we're not. So I think we need to beef up the personnel at the borders, and there's been some fairly concerning scenes from airports in the newspapers this week of people from red and green countries mixing. But ultimately I think we need to weigh up the cost of the negligible risk of someone who is double vaccinated following all the protocol with tests either side against the vast impact to people like Jack.
