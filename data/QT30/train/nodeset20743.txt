Victor Adebowale[0:20:36] I think what would be really good is if the government could spend serious money on a public education campaign about the availability of safe spaces but also to start educating men about how to operate, how to use their own spatial awareness to ensure that they are respectful of everyone but particularly of women. I think it is totally unacceptable for any woman to feel unsafe and to have to think twice before leaving their home to take exercise. While my heart goes out to the family of Sara Everard, we must ensure that deaths, and the horrific circumstances in which her family are currently existing, that we learn something, there's a lot of fear out there and we owe it to women with practical things we can do now. I've just suggested a few. Let's do this. Let's start now.

AudienceMember 20210318QT16[0:21:34] Hello. Yes, I completely agree. That's exactly what I was going to say. We need to educate boys from quite a young age. You know, getting through to them that that kind of behaviour isn't acceptable.
