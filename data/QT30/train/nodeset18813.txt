Audience Speaker[0:43:22] Imran: I also wanted to mention I think that especially in London, rent is far too high for what people are earning, and I think the Government needs to do more in people. Because as a young people, saving for a deposit when I am paying rent in London that's extortionately high and trying to save for a deposit. I think rent regulation is sincerely another point that the Government need to look into.

Luke McCroy-Jones[0:43:50] I think another important consideration here of course is that the same city that the development, the billion pound development was approved in was the same city that three years ago had the Grenfell Tower tragedy and still there are blocks in dangerous, so when is the Government actually going to act and protect people in this tower block housing?

George MPanga[0:44:12] Can I just add to that point? I don't know if it's already been covered, but the CIL, that levy --

Fiona Bruce[0:44:20] That's the infrastructure levy, which is paid for by developers and it goes towards the Council for them to use for local services.

George MPanga[0:44:28] That's right. In this Robert Jenrick case, it is said that the decision to green light that one being in development was fast tracked so as to help the developer to avoid I think a 40 million plus payment into the community, that levy would have mandated. I'd also like to make a clarification. I don't think it was the Government in 2018 decided community should be consulted. I think it was actually the Mayor.
