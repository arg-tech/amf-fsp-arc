Audience Member 20211028QT22 [00:25:38] Gender-based violence doesn't just happen to women. Mr Sarwar, again you mentioned misogyny. Do you know what the male equivalent is of misogyny? It's misandry. There is actually a word for it. I appreciate that violence against women is horrendous, it's on the rise, and it's terrible.Fiona Bruce[00:26:05] And is the greater part.Audience Member 20211028QT23 [00:26:07] And it is the greater part. But we shouldn't forget that it does happen to men as well. Men get their drinks spiked, men get jabbed, and I think it would be a mistake to focus completely only on femaleâ€¦ If we talk about gender violence and we only ever talk about women, we forget that it happens to men.Fiona Bruce[00:26:31] Okay, the woman here in the blue dress.Audience Member 20211028QT24 [00:26:34] Hi, I'm a former police inspector, having served in Scotland and down in the Met and County Forces, and I just want to look at some of the aspects of what the panel have been saying about this. First of all, we need to gather intelligence, and if we don't get people coming forward, male or female, coming forwad and talking to the police, allowing themselves to be forensically examined, because we don't know what type of people it is.
