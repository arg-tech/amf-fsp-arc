Fiona Bruce[0:19:44] There's a lot of shaking heads from our audience; Anneliese.

Anneliese Dodds[0:19:50] One question to Grant. Why can't your government announce earlier whether things like the business rates holiday will be continued or the furlough will be continued? It feels like you left this off until the budget to have that big political event. The problem is for these business people, they are trying to say to their employees whether they can keep them on, whether they are going to be in work in the next few months. They can't do that when they don't have the certainty.

Grant Shapps[0:20:20] All the support remains.

Anneliese Dodds[0:20:22] Not before next Wednesday, but it ends, for example, before some of it -- some of that support ends before businesses -- let me finish. If I may finish. Nothing ends before next Wednesday, but if you run a business, a pub or a restaurant, you can't be, you know, speedily changing decisions in a matter of days. The support does end, some of it, before indoor hospitality is allowed to open according to the roadmap. That is giving people like this an enormous headache.
