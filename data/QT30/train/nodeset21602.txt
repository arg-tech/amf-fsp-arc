[0:44:20] It is like an episode of Line of Duty, all these shadowy dealings in smoke-filled cars and pubs, it is extraordinary reading. What we are missing is the wonderful Vicky McClure. Cressida is a remarkable woman to have made the top job in the Met Police. Her achievements. If that organisation is institutionally corrupt, deem that it was, at least at that time, institutionally sexist and at the time Cressida rows to the top, I know she will be taking this very seriously and will come back properly with a full response.

[0:45:12] Thank you. Does the Australian trade deal set a terrible precedent and threaten the long-term viability of British farming?

Fiona Bruce
[0:45:22] Ian, you've been talking about this in the House of Commons.

Ian Blackford
[0:45:26] I have to say I'm deeply worried what this means for farming and indeed for crofters as well. We shouldn't just be thinking about the Australian deal because this is the first trade deal the UK has done of this kind and could open the door for similar deals with Argentina, Brazil, the US, and with Canada as well.
