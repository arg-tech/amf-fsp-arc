[0:43:20] I think globally, there's going to be some sort of redistribution of vaccines whether it's the vaccines themselves or the intellectual property rights. It might also be the case here in Britain we hit a point of which we judge that we have protected the most vulnerable in our society, people of a certain age or people with certain health conditions. Now, that is the point at which we should start to redistribute our own vaccines or put other vehicles first. That poses an interesting question to my generation because I am proud to say I'm far too young to have received a vaccine yet, far too young.

[0:43:58] Am I willing to delay getting the vaccine just as the country is opening-up, am I willing to delay my own liberation from lockdown in order to help people overseas? I have to say personally I very much am. I'm not just being virtuous here, and I'm saying that because I think that those of us who are relatively young, and healthy have got to be willing to balance risk and to take risks to put the vulnerable first, but accept that we ourselves should live with a certain amount of danger because you could catch Covid. You could be done run down by a car.
