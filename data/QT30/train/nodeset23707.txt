If it was a large corporation or someone who was well of, you would care, it just seems like you don't care about people who are poor and struggling. That's what it seems like, it seems like the government doesn't care.
Fiona Bruce[0:06:46] Do you want to reply to that, I mean, because the thing is, you certainly have listed a whole load of initiatives, but you hear people say, well, so what? The fact it, it doesn't feel like that to us.
Grant Shapps[0:06:54] Yeah, look, first of all, the number of people in absolutely poverty I'm pleased to say has been falling and has continued to fall, and that's because we've done things for people who are in work, for example, the national living wage, which didn't even exist when we came into power, that's actually increased people's salary at the lower end by four thousand pounds a year. It was not even a thing. Now, I understand about the points that the lady was saying about not being in work and therefore the other benefits which would need to be there to help provide help and support.
