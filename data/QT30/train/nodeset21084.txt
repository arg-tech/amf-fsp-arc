Ryan?Ryan Unknown[00:56:37] Yeah, I would just say that I just find it, kind of, not overly surprising but just amazing that the same people who have for the last year voted for these really tight restrictions on our civil liberties and freedoms then discuss how they're going to fix the problems that have been caused by those laws in place. And I know that the response will probably be that we'd no alternative but this has been a year now, we've had a year to really think about things.
