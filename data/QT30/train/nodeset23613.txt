AudienceMember 20211014QT42[0:45:54] Currently, in 2021, just over half the police forces in the country have had that training, and my question really, I know it is about Prince Andrew, but it is a wider question, why are local police forces allowed to make a decision that they will put domestic abuse lower down the training than any other training and it does not help when the Prime Minister says that the police force should be investigating serious crimes, which is what he said the other day.
Fiona Bruce[0:46:26] Rosie, let's come back to the question. Should Prince Andrew, in view of his public denial, I want to reiterate again that Prince Andrew has denied and he has not been charged, he has denied the allegations, should Prince Andrew go to the States and face his accuser in court?
Rosie Jones[0:46:42] I agree with what a lot of people here said tonight. I don't care who he is. The pure fact of it, he is a man who has been accused of a serious sexual crime. It isn't a question - of course he needs to face that allegation. Of course.
Fiona Bruce[0:47:32] Okay. Nadhim?
Nadhim Zahawi[0:47:36] I think it is important to remember that Virginia Giuffre was caused great pain by Epstein. I think Lisa Nandy is right, that has to be foremost in our minds.
