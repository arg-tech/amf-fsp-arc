[00:27:45] Briefly, Andrew.

Andrew RT Davies
[00:27:44] But in fairness the rhetoric has been dialled up on the continent of Europe. Twice now they've come back with various measures. I want to see the vaccine programme be a success in Europe as well but we're not the people sending military police into factories to seize vaccines like the Italians did the other day. That is dialling up the dial way too loud, and what we've got to work together…I haven't heard UK Government ministers threatening any action in retaliation to what the European Union have…

Vaughan Gething
[00:28:10] Actually, I think there has been some unhelpful commentary from some parts of the UK Government. 

Andrew RT Davies
[00:28:14] Well, quote it. 

Vaughan Gething
[00:28:15] I think you'll find the Foreign Secretary hasn't been wonderfully helpful with all of his comments. I also think when we're talking about people respecting it…

Fiona Bruce
[00:28:20] Like what in particular, Vaughan, are you referring to? 

Vaughan Gething
[00:28:22] People respecting international obligations and international agreements that are made is not something the UK comes with entirely clean hands.
