[00:18:36] How are you going to make Collette trust you then, Nadhim?

Nadhim Zahawi
[00:18:37] So I'll try and have a go. One is that the early evidence is that the vaccines work on the Indian variant, and the JCV or the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation bringing forward the second dose to eight week interval is making a difference. We are serge vaccinating in areas like Bolton and Blackburn and Darwin. We're also surge testing in those areas, and I think the thing to do is to make sure we continue to vaccinate at pace as Johnathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, has said, this is a race between the vaccine and of course the test, trace and isolate, and the virus. The virus will continue to mutate, we have to make sure… Part of my role is to future proof the vaccination programme so that if there is a virus of concern we have a variant vaccine ready for it, which is why we're doing that work, and we'll talk more about that now, but…

Fiona Bruce
[00:19:38] Okay. That's not quite what Collette was talking about I don't think. But, Devi, let's hear from you.
