[Thomas]: I wanted to make a quick comment. My wife and I would shop between Lidl’s and Tesco. What we found since 31 December is Lidl have been much better stocked than Tesco. The first week Tesco had nothing and we had to depend on everything in Lidl. Lidl had been so much better stocked in terms of meat, fruit and veg. I don’t know what they are doing differently but it seems not to have affected them as much. 

Fiona Bruce [00:21:50] I know Lidl were saying they were preparing for two years. They will be thrilled with your endorsement, I’m sure. Clearly other supermarkets are available: Chris. 

[Chris]: I wonder to what extent are these little hiccups at the port are actually happening. From my point of view, an end-user’s point of view, I have no point when I go to the shops, they’re fully stocked. If I go to buy fuel it is fully stocked. I purchased by email three items recently, including these headphones, a new doormat and boot polish. 

Fiona Bruce [00:22:28] All essential items, Chris
