Fiona Bruce[00:25:17] Kate, I'm so sorry to interrupt, but let me just ask you this, Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out holding a sort of wildcat illegal referendum if the UK government doesn't give consent. The UK government isn't giving consent at the moment with no sign of when it's going to do so, so how are you going to resolve this?
Kate Forbes[00:25:33] Well, can I just say how ridiculous that situation is, that Boris Johnson again, the leader of a party that has been rejected consistently in Scotland since 1955, is telling the people of Scotland that have just voted overwhelmingly for pro-independence MSPs that there is no…
Fiona Bruce[00:25:46] So how are you going to resolve it?
Kate Forbes[00:25:48]…democratic way, there is no democratic way to deliver that. So I would hope that we become democrats again, respect the way that the people of Scotland voted. All parties signed up after 2014 to the Smith Commission that said that there was nothing to stop people in Scotland from voting for independence. And at its very heart is a question for all of us, which is if this union, one based on a partnership of consent, or does it only exist through force of law. And that is a fundamental question that we all face right now. And I think increasingly more and more people see that the democratic route to putting that question back to the people is the most important one.
