[0:54:44] Thanks, Fiona. Andy, I think you should stay on the role you're doing in Manchester. I heard direct first-hand compliments of the work that you did regarding the bomb interview years ago. I never heard any complements of anything that you did when you were in Parliament. There may well have been, but I never heard of them. Fantastic work going on at a local level like that is surely, surely the way that your party in particular is going to come out of this. You've already alluded to that. Why on Earth would you want to go back into the main Parliament?

[0:55:24] We already heard that he does want to, and we'll see it when it comes. Fatima.

[0:55:32] If Labour can't hold this seat with this particular candidate that's standing then I don't know about the final nail, but I think it is a hard nail in the coffin. I agree with Chika, it is going to be a really uphill struggle for the party to rally back. I know there are peaks and troughs, but coming so far on the back of the loss in Hartleool, it is going to be difficult.
