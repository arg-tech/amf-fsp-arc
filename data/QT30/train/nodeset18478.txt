Fiona Bruce [00:31:04] Vaughan, when it comes to Wales, the First Minister has said he doesn’t expect most of Welsh tourism to be running this summer at all, at best hope self-catering, so what do you think in response to what Rosina said and what Rocco Forte has had to say?

Vaughan Gething [00:31:19] Well, it’s difficult, but I’m very proud of the fact that our government in Wales, has as our priority how to keep Wales safe. We’ve taken a deliberately cautious approach to easing out of lockdown, because I simply disagree with Rocco’s characterisation of Covid-19 and its impact. It is a dreadful disease, it’s taken thousands of extra lives, tens of thousands across the UK, and would have taken many more if we hadn’t imposed lockdown when we did. And I don’t think you can try to balance off health against economy. If we come out of lockdown too quickly, we’ll not only see lives lost, we will see a much greater impact upon our economy. So, we are looking at a range of measures that we take, which have more economic activity take place, but to do so unashamedly on the basis that we’ve got to do this in the safest way possible, and that does mean necessary caution
