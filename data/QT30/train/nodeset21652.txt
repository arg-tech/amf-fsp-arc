Fiona Bruce[0:17:54] Now another question from Stephanie.
AudienceMember 20210708QT07[0:17:56] Hi. Good evening. The new Health Secretary says we need to learn to live with the virus. What does that mean and how will society look without restrictions?
Fiona Bruce[0:18:08] There's me talking about what September will look like. Benjamin, what's your view? The Prime Minister has already said today that we may have some restrictions in place even after July 19th. We don't know what they will be. How do you see life after COVID? Or living with COVID?
Benjamin Zephaniah[0:18:28] It looks very depressing. I'm kind of half laughing, I don't know why. Every time I come on this programme I bring up the subject of veganism. Evidence shows the more we cut down rain forests, the more we come into contact with animals that don't want to come into contact with us. The animals know better. We cut down the forests, we encounter them. Viruses will keep jumping from them to us. I think Covid-19 is one thing but there's a lot more to come. It is the consequences of our actions. I heard today that it's from a study in the University of Utrecht that human beings are now giving Covid-19 to their pet, to their cats and dogs. Now, imagine if it mutates again and then comes back to us. I mean, this is really scary.
