Fiona Bruce [00:04:36] Are you satisfied with the way Boris is handling it? 
David Ross [00:04:40] There have been mistakes by governments around the world. There have been errors made -- 
Fiona Bruce [00:04:46] What, the UK government has done wrong. 
David Ross [00:04:48] At some time we’ll say this or that should have been done differently. But I don’t think no one can say what has been the big difference in Scotland. What has the Scottish government done differently from the UK. There are areas where the Scottish government have to learn, for example, testing positive people for Covid-19 in a hospital and putting them into a care home. That’s the worst thing that could have happened. 
Audience Speaker [00:05:12] So with regard to mistakes and Nicola Sturgeon, what is the evidence that the First Minister has used in justifying her decision to crush the hospitality sector and saying the spike has come from pubs, bars and restaurant? 
Fiona Bruce [00:05:28] I’m going to deal with the main question. Has it been managed better by Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon? Neither of you want to say and you are at pains to point out it is not a competition. But it matters to people who has handled it well.
