Fiona Bruce [00:56:56] You think the universities should pay up if students fell or are able to prove they haven’t had enough teaching? 

Michelle Donelan [00:57:02] I have seen wonderful examples of blended learning, where universities have gone to produce great learning. Just because it is online does not mean it is inferior. Not at all. Are there some students that feel dissatisfied? Absolutely. We heard that. There’s a process in place for them. They complain to their university, then they can go to the OIA, the office of the independent adjudicator. They can get fashionable re didn’t understand or full refund based on that. 

Fiona Bruce [00:57:36] Have any students succeeded in that. 

Michelle Donelan [00:57:38] Yes, in the past before as well with the strikes that we saw. There were a number of students going through that. Obviously there’s a time lag because they do the complaint first to the university. Nobody is denying it hasn’t been difficult, of course it has. But a number of universities have really invested in that blended learning model. But I totally take on board the comments and recognise the process that should be followed. 

Fiona Bruce [00:58:04] Georgia, does that answer your question? 

[Georgia]: Yes, thank you. 
Fiona Bruce [00:58:10] That’s a satisfied customer, that’s what you like to hear.
