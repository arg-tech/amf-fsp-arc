That's a heck of a discrepancy.Steve Barclay[0:46:26] That's why we have strengthened the safety net. One of the measures that we took at the budget was to change the rent that's covered to 30% to support people in terms of the cost of rent. We have taken measures specifically about the challenges of people paying. Ultimately this is about the supply and the demand issue. The key thing we need to do is build more homes. We're committed to funding that but we also need to make the planning system more friendly to delivering on that, and we also need to look at the skills. It comes back to the earlier point. You know, skills for young people who we need to find employment for, the construction industry is a key part of that, the infrastructure we're committing, and that's how we bounce back from the pandemic that we have faced.Emma Stephenson[0:47:14] What changes we have made in society in response to Coronavirus should be kept once restrictions are lifted?Fiona Bruce[0:47:22] What changes should we keep?
