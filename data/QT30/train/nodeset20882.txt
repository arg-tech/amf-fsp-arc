Claire Fox[00:34:25] So what I think we need to do, because I do think there does end up being this thing about saying I want to say and associate myself with the nurses because that will show how virtuous I am, you isolate them as a special group, but it's quite divisive.

But so many people are facing unemployment, so many people are facing wage cuts, to just say it's only the nurses that we should consider, I mean, remember the furloughed staff have basically had a 20 per cent pay cut and lots of them are going to face losing their job and according to the politicians in Wales, if you work in tourism, you can forget it, you're not going to have a job. What about them?
