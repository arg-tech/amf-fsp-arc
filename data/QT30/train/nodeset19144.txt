Fiona Bruce[0:13:26]Let’s hear from our audience. Jane P.
Female Aud 1[0:13:29]I like everybody has been horrified by this story as it’s unfolded over the years, and we’ve heard today that the Labour party are legally accountable, but really they are an entity, and surely there must be some individual people held accountable. Are there any legal redresses that will ensure that the people behind this really are accountable? It’s one thing being expelled from your political party, but to me that isn’t enough for the situation that’s happened. To drag hate crime into politics is a pretty serious thing, and so against the British way of life.

Female Aud 2[0:14:18]Thank you, Fiona. I want to come back on Nick’s point where he said that don’t judge by words but judge by actions. Prejudice is often displayed through words and words do matter. And I want to come back to Chris because he’s very quickly gone in and criticised Keir Starmer, but I would remind him that the Conservative party has also been accused of racism against people of Islamic faith, so when can we look forward to an investigation into their practices and see some apologies and of course some criticism from the top there too?
