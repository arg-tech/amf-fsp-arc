Fiona Bruce[0:23:06] It doesn't feel safe to her.AudienceMember 20210318QT18[0:23:08] Yeah, it's just sad.Fiona Bruce[0:23:10] Bonny, it strikes me there are cases every now and again that grab the attention. I'm thinking -- I mean, I've been around a bit and I remember the case of Rachel Nickle, the woman murdered with her child in London. Yet again there was a lot of soul-searching about what can be done, how can women feel safe. Here we are having the same conversation again.Bonnie Greer[0:23:34] I want to say someone who didn't grow up and wasn't born here but I lived here half my life, this is a deeply masculine society at its roots. There are clubs not far from where I live that admit no women. That is a mindset. There are schools where there are no women. I once asked, I think it was Robin Cooke, the late Robin Cooke, I asked why were British men so afraid of women and he said they don't go to school with them. So the idea of educating men is very important -- and little boys. But I go back to the society I was born in. Hardly perfect, but what we had to do was put people in place so people could see.
