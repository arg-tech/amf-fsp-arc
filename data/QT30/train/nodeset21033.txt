Anas Sarwar[00:31:37] We keep hearing about the Saudi Arabia of renewables, we heard it from Alex Salmond before, we've heard it from Boris Johnson now, we're hearing it now from the Scottish government again. We've got to invest seriously and genuinely in those renewable jobs of the future so we can genuinely transition people from the oil and gas industry into renewables. And that work is not happening and [voices overlap 31:41] was a perfect example of that.
Keith Brown[00:31:44] Eighty per cent of our fuel is fuelled by renewables.
Fiona Bruce[00:31:43] Okay. Willie? 
Willie Rennie[00:31:46] So, what we need to do is we need to reduce the demand for oil and gas. That means making sure we change the heating in our homes. So, we want to convert from gas the heating in our homes to things like air source heat pumps and other renewables. We want to make sure we have district heating systems that uses hydrogen; also hydrogen for transport. We need to make sure the tremendous potential we've got off the shore and Lorna's talked about it already, with the wind farms, the great opportunities there, a huge resource.
