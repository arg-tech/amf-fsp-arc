AudienceMember 20211111QT23[1:06:38] Paul put it absolutely beautifully. I have little to add. I think the issue of complicity is an important one. Sometimes you think what difference can I make when this is going on and standing up and speaking out and speaking truth and not being complicit is something we can all do, whether it is something we are overhearing on a train or if it is happening in a sports place or anywhere else. So I think there is a responsibility on all of us. I do find the way the Yorkshire cricket club handled this -- the way it dismissed it as not a big deal. I want to give a shout-out to the campaign Hope Not Hate that is standing up for this, running a campaign right now about getting racism out of sport, out of British life altogether.
