Fiona Bruce [00:16:02] The community pharmacy, there are 11,000 of them, have been saying today they typically do the flu jab vaccine, they know how to do it, they want to help with the coronavirus vaccine but they haven’t been able to. We spoke to a trade body before they came on air. They said the applications to do so have been closed since 6 December. They cannot help. Why won’t you let them help? Are you going to let the community pharmacies do the jobs? There’s 11,000 of them. 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:16:34] I hear you. If I can take you through the plan. It is important for everybody here, whether Annaliese in the Labour Party or the audience. So the plan is you’ve got hospital hubs, they have been operationalised, then the primary care networks. So 5 or 6 GPs in an area of 50,000 people come together, deciding who will lead, the others will support, then delivering really for work because they can reach the over 80s and they are going into the care homes because they are the most vulnerable people to this virus, the over 80s. Then the NHS frontline and social care, then we get to groups 3 and 4. Bear with me for a second. Beyond the primary care network, so 595 already vaccinating. By the end of the week that’s risen by 200. It will keep rising. Ultimately we get to about 1,500 sites because we are adding on national vaccination centres that will come online in details, and the community pharmacies which you talk about. 115 will come on line on the 11th of this month.
