Audience Member [00:36:20] Given the extension of the lockdown, I wonder how much is being done to implement this lockdown. My perception is that the roads are as busy as ever they were. I see people in the shops. I see people congregating together who are not -- people congrea together quite apparent. In terms of the wear in terms of especially talking about it moving on to Easter, what is being done to ensure that people are following the rules. If they’re not following the rules, then it’s kind of what is the point in keeping on extending things for longer.[DONE] 
Fiona Bruce [00:37:02] Karl, let’s hear from you. 
Audience Member [00:37:08] I think we all underestimated how far-reaching COVID was going to be for our everyday lives. I suppose, thinking about it at the time, that the three-month initial lockdown was going to sort things out, I think that was a big mistake and when it comes to this time now that we’re in, I think the people are suffering from lockdown fatigue. When the administration or when the government is asking people to do things they think that it’s possibly one rule for certain people, another rule for other people.
