Fiona Bruce[0:32:28] Okay. We've got another question from Katrin Bass.
Audience Member 20210930QT18[0:32:33] Hi. Do you agree that the police should have extra powers to remove climate change protectors?
Fiona Bruce[0:32:41] Protestors, soâ€¦
AudienceMember 20210930QT19[0:32:42] Yes, thank you.
Fiona Bruce[0:32:42] So obviously we've seen these protests on the M25, the government's now taken out an injunction, but what do you think, Katrin?
AudienceMember 20210930QT20[0:32:48] Well, so I'm a self-employed florist, I work for myself, obviously, and I was thinking about that, I was listening to the Jeremy Vine show as I do every day, and they were talking about, and I was quite upset in a way, because if you're stuck there, like in my case, for example, if I have a coffin spray in the back of my delivery van and I can't get to that funeral because the road is blocked, then that's not very nice for these people, especially I've worked all through the pandemic as well by myself, because I got the flowers direct delivered from Holland, so that was actually possible to do that, I didn't have to go to the wholesalers, so they stuck it in my home garage where I worked behind closed doors. So I done loads and loads and loads of funerals, and then so to have to deal with, that hardly anyone could go to the funerals, that was really hard for me as well.
