[PETER KYLE] : I think it is a sad conversation that we're having here. I think every profession needs to have people from different backgrounds and apparently types that is driving creativity, whether sporting or artistic, politics, public life or any other walk of life, is informed by people's backgrounds. Some people have hidden challenges, other people have seen challenges. But Naomi has a challenge which is unseen and yet everybody is expecting her in her personality to conform to everything else. Her personality type is clearly helping her creativity and sporting performance. I do not see why it's not possible for her sport and the people running her sport to make an individual decision about whether individual players can cope with being in the public eye or not. Why would we drive people out of a sporting profession because they don't have the personality type, which is an alpha personality type? In politics, it is a huge shame that introverts find politics is impossible. We miss out on people who bring a different power to the way they think and the discussions that they have because they're too scared to get involved in the real to and fro.
