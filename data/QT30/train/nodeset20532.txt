Fiona Bruce[0:52:24] Sam, you have five kids. So are you desperate to get them to summer school?
Audience Member 20[0:52:32] No. Summer is summer. It's our summer. No, I mean, they have been put under enough pressure with all the home learning, parents have been put under a lot of pressure, and teachers as well. I think we all deserve that six weeks of fun time. My two eldest boys who are year 11 and year 13 have been stuck in that bedroom 6 hours a day, five days a week. You know, putting in extra lessons, no, I don't think it is fair. The same with my two youngest. You know, I don't mind if it's an after-school thing a couple of times a week, maybe, during term time, but not during the summer. I just think it is so unfair. No.
