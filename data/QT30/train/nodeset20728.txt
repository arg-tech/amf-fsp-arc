AudienceMember 20210318QT01[0:03:36] Sexism, harassment and violence against women continues to present a real and devastating threat to our safety and ultimately to our lives. When we will we learn that this is a problem for society and not a problem for women?Fiona Bruce[0:03:52] Becky, we are all absorbing the news about 32 year old Sara Everard who went missing last week.

AudienceMember 20210318QT02[0:04:04] I am, but also I don't think I know a single woman in my life who hasn't been sexually harassed or experienced some kind of negative attention be it from men, which is really, really saddening. It is just so common. It has almost become accepted. I think that women face real restrictions in their lives and what they can do.
