Fiona Bruce[0:25:12] Charlie, you are shaking your head at that?
AudienceMember 20210624QT18[0:25:14] It is basically people saying do we have freedom or should we be told what to do. And the Panel tonight, you know everybody seems to be saying something sensible and something stupid. Ian, he should take over the Labour Party as captain in hindsight, going on about the desperate need for support that the businesses that have been delayed a month. Every single person, and it is coming across with us as well, is on one hand saying something then basically contradicting themselves in the next sentence. We don't know, we really don't know. I run an outdoor events business. It is horrible at the moment. However, I understand that it's going to be horrible and I understand that we have to make sacrifices. At the moment, the way the Delta variant is going, yeah, it's not great. We need to be careful.
Fiona Bruce[0:26:18] Daniel.
Daniel Finkelstein[0:26:20] I heard about Mark saying scientists being wheeled out. Better than wheeling out me.
Daniel Finkelstein[0:26:32] You are wheeling out somebody who doesn't know when you are wheeling out me. In fact, all of us don't know. The scientists themselves are making estimates but they are doing it on a basis --
Fiona Bruce[0:26:42] Some of them disagree.
Daniel Finkelstein[0:26:44] But they are doing it on the basis of proper modelling and a lot of medical knowledge. You know, with respect, Mark, in November you urged a course which would have been disastrous, and on a reasonable basis which is we didn't know for certain that things were going to be as bad as the scientists said. I always said we don't know that for certain, it could be worse. Indeed it was.
