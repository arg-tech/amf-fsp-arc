[HEATHER MCGREGOR] : Two other points. I was ready pleased that MasterCard, her big sponsor, went straight out behind her and said, you know, we back you 100 percent. Because, if anything was going to make that whole thing fall apart it was if her sponsors all turned their backs on her. The second thing I would say is I see young people all the time in my job at that stage and I think as universities we have a responsibility to people between the ages of 17 and 24 or whatever to equip them to go out into the world. It is a tough, difficult place to be and, as has already been mentioned, this is something, you know, that happens to lots of people. This is one of the most common things, anxiety, depression. I think it is important that we equip our young people. That's what I set out to do all the time, equip our young people with the skills and capabilities. Not just exam passes but to be able to deal with things. So I would just like to see her play tennis. That's what I feel as a fan.
