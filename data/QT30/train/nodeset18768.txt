Emma [0:12:28] I echo what Hanna just said, in that, you know,my family are all pretty much NHS workers, so although you might be taking a risk yourself, if you get ill you end up in hospital as putting people like that at risk as well. And George also mentioned about, you know, having clear messaging and, you know, people using that to make decisions.
