Fiona Bruce[0:19:50] okay. Shaun. [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : I'm just thinking, you know, we are a country of around 66.5 million, you know, and I'm just -- if we keep -- you know, the gentlemen on the panel wants to consider a model of suppressing the virus. To what point? There are always going to be new variants. You know, you can't keep us locked up forever. We have to be released at some point. [ANTHONY COSTELLO] : Can I just say about lockdown, if you look at the countries that have been most successful, the Asian states, they suppress the virus by proper public health control measures. They have death rates of China 3 per million, Vietnam less than 1 per million. We're at 1,900 per million deaths and we've had three lockdowns, they've had none, their economy is thriving. If you think you can live with a dangerous virus like this that will keep coming back and throwing variants at us which are more and more transmissible and more virtual, we have another thing coming. We should have invested, we should have had a test, trace and isolate programme with properly supported isolation, which we still don't have in this country. We should have had that a year ago. We're just playing the same game time and time again.
