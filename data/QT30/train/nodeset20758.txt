But I think we need to separate the Royal Family from the institution as Bonnie pointed out. On the question of the press, it is clear it is racist just in the way they described Megan. They made the racist comments about her being from the "hood", gang type stuff. They didn't do that with any other princess. It is clear. Indeed, the resignation of the director of the society of editors because of the backlash of the defence of the tabloid press says it all.
