[JENNI MURRAY] : They chose to be a landlord. They could have some sort of empathy in the current economic climate. They can probably get their mortgage redone. Talk to the building society about it. There are always ways of getting around that kind of thing. But if you're a very poor woman with children, living alone, with no resources, and no knowledge of how to argue these things and where to find help, it's just criminal. It really is. [FIONA BRUCE] : Andrea. [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Thanks, Fiona. Again, I'm really empathising with with what Jenni is saying. I've been in that position. I've been in a position where myself and my daughter were effectively homeless and it is a really horrible place to be. I was fortunate enough that I could get in a car and go live with my parents for a year or two. But being in that situation is like nothing that I would wish on my worst enemy.
