Richard Walker[00:12:00] One in ten people are employed in travel and tourism in this business and in this country and it's their livelihoods that's at stake, and indeed the wider economy. I think we wiped off something like Â£150 billion last year off our economy because of the shut down in travel. And finally, the wellness and mental health of that well-earned holiday in the sun, albeit not in Greenland, a week abroad, which is something to aspire to. I'd just like to end by saying that I think ultimately it's a bit irrelevant anyway because we cannot hermetically seal our borders. Whilst people in and out of airports has dropped 95 per cent, actually there's 10,000 trucks a day coming over our land borders to pay for things like the clothes we wear, the food we eat, and indeed all the vaccines that we're getting jabbed with, or some of them. So I think we kind of need to face reality here and understand that we cannot make ourselves completely COVID secure and safe for everyone and just seal up the country.
