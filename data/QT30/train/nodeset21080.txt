Lorna Slater[00:53:50] So, we've all talked about the, kind of, acute issues, addressing the immediate issues of COVID. But let's also look at the bigger picture and look at restructuring our economy because those are all things we can do something about. We can work together cross-party to build a national care service to stop that bed blocking, to lift the pressure on the NHS. We can work together to alleviate poverty in Scotland, to implement fair policies, living wages, a universal basic income, affordable housing so that people don't suffer from that kind of grinding poverty. And things like reliable income, you know, fair work, knowing that you're going to have the money at the end of the month to pay the bills â€“ that goes a long way to alleviate the kind of mental health crisis that we do see in Scotland.
