Unknown Speaker[00:01:50] Are those food shortages in supermarkets since 1st of January, teething problems with Brexit or are there are much deeper issues with the Irish sea boarder customs protocol?

Fiona Bruce[00:02:12] Do you want to kick us off?

Arlene Foster[00:02:18] The protocol was brought in by Boris Johnson to try to get Brexit done. By doing so, it separated Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom, something we warned about. Since the protocol came in, there have been difficulties with like steel, which we have worked to get sorted out, with pets’ travel, parcels, a whole range of items. We warned the prime minister about this which is why we voted against the withdrawal agreement. We said it was going to cause great difficulties. It arose because of a skewed understanding of the Belfast Agreement. What is really important to Northern Ireland is the trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, both ways. So it is important that we deal with all of the issues in the protocol. The prime minister said recently he will use Article 16 if necessary, and that means he will take unilateral action to protect the citizens and EXHURMS which citizens of Northern Ireland and we would urge him to work Ireland and we would urge him to work with us to make sure there isn’t damage to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.
