Fiona Bruce [00:33:25] Lisa-Marie?
Female Aud 4[00:33:26] Hi, sorry, in Wales, more than 95 per cent of our businesses are small and micro businesses, and at the moment, there is zero admissions going into Gwent, and there are really low admissions going into Heath Hospital. So, there’s no evidence really, to suggest keeping a lockdown in place, but also have they already taken into account what impact this is going to have on all these small businesses, and our economy in Wales, which could be severely affected if we keep some of these guidelines in place?
Fiona Bruce [Shakeel 00:33:58].
Male Aud 4[00:33:59] I just wanted to ask, once furlough has ended, should we prepare for mass redundancies for businesses that can no longer function in the new normal?
Fiona Bruce [00:34:07] And let me hear from John?
Male Aud 5[00:34:09] The economy in Wales has always been a House of Cards, we’re very dependant on the public sector. And we should have been leading the way in reopening, but we’re not, we’re forever days, weeks behind, what Westminster’s doing, and really the Welsh Assembly sits on its hands for three weeks, in between thawing out a few little tit bits of very, very minor trivial relaxing.
