Nigel Owens[00:17:52] But it's a global pandemic, isn't it? And we need to get on top of it globally, I think, and, you know, if the boot was on the other foot that the other countries were keeping the vaccination and not giving us anything, we certainly wouldn't be happy, so I think there needs to be a little bit of common sense and a little bit of balance and transparency and honesty, and yes, we need to get on top of it, we need to get it out within our own communities and within our society, but also as well we must make sure that we do all we can as well in helping other countries as well to get on top of it. I think that's hugely important.
