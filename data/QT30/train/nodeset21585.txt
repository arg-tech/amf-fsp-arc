[0:15:02] Rosemary, given the infection rate has been rising here, do you have any sympathy with the idea it is best to delay for four weeks to try to stop another wave?

Rosemary Squire
[0:15:18] It is contradictory, what's happening at the moment. None of the pilots that were held in theatre, the Crucible Theatre, the date does not show that transmission increases whether a theatre is 25%, 50% or 100% just to give you an example it is trading in London at 70 percent, in the regions, where I am in Cornwall, there are no theatres open at the moment. It is down to 4 or 5% regionally. This is people's businesses, their jobs, their livlihoods. So many people, freelancers have not been eligible for the furlough. It has been a nightmare, 16 months. The sooner we can get back, the better. There's no evidence to say performing in a theatre, where you all look forwards, you don't necessarily talk to anyone apart from the person in your bubble who is sitting next to you. We need to get on and get back. What we need is certainty around a date. So we have to stick to this July date. And if we can't stick to that July date, what we need is an industry, and we are a huge industry.
