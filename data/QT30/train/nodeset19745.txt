Chris Auron [00:20:38] We have entered a third lockdown. How many more lives were lost before the government decided to call this lockdown? Fiona Bruce [00:20:50] I know you are asking this because of what happened to your mother. Will you tell us briefly your story? [Chris Auron] yes. My mom, in the picture behind me, is 58 year old. I lost my mum on 9 April last year to COVID. There’s -- it’s been incredibly difficult as a family. There are 76,000 families out there that are now grieving the loss of loved ones, let alone how this is affecting our key workers. For example, the nurses in that hospital. My mum’s last support she had in her last moments was having two nurses hold her hands as she passed away. Fiona Bruce [00:21:36] I know you weren’t able to see her, Chris, but she was constantly in contact with you, talking about the kind of care she was receiving. Chris Auron [00:21:46] Yes, mum messaged for all of the 9 days she was in hospital, she messaged us last, actually, about four and a half hours before she passed away, that she said the nurses were amazing there but they were completely overwhelmed. This was during the first lockdown, during the first wave. Now, from what I hear, you know, we’ve got 30,000 people in intensive care units fighting for their lives. It is almost 3 times worse now than it was in the first. I wouldn’t want anybody to go through what I’m going through as a family and as 76,000 other families out there are going through the same.[DONE]
