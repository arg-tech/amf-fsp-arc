Fiona Bruce[0:13:34] Is the government wrong to back down today?
Paul Scully[0:13:40] What I was going to say, that's why I voted about the process. It is fair that someone should be able to go through that. It did not overturn what the Commissioner for Standards actually found because they would have had that due process and that would have come back whatever the result was. But, no, then, obviously, Owen Paterson has forced the issue by resigning. I think, clearly there was a case to answer, absolutely there was a case to answer.
