[FIONA BRUCE] : There are quite a few hands up. Let me come back to our audience. Sam, you are the mother of five children. What's your view? [AUDIENCE MEMBER] : Teachers have worked so hard over the last few months. It is disheartening to know that funding is going to be cut. My two boys now are going to be awaiting GCSE and A-level results in August. We pray that they've put enough work in, but the teachers have just been such a credit. I completely agree, you know, they've worked so hard with the kids. You know, it is so unfair that the funding is not going to be there. [FIONA BRUCE] : Charlie?AudienceMember 20210610QT03[0:12:22] Hi. I've got two daughters, one aged 20, one aged 18, second year of University, doing A-levels. The one at university, her experience has, quite frankly, been shafted. The A-level one, ditto. And we've got to a stage where, okay, sometimes that happens. Please don't let it affect other year groups. Let's do something about what we can and put money into those ones that we can actually affect and change.
