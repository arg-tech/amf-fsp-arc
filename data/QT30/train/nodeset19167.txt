Part 28 Fiona Bruce[0:43:19] Nick, I’m just going to jump in because not only… Nick. Nick, I’m so sorry, I’m just going to jump in because not only are you in a circuit breaker it looks like your computer’s having a bit of a circuit breakdown as well…
Bonnie Greer[0:43:30]Yeah.
Fiona Bruce[0:43:30]…and we can hear you but we can’t see you.
Bonnie Greer[0:43:32]I’d say he’s gone too.
Fiona Bruce[0:43:32]So I will try and come back to you as soon as we manage to get that reinstated. Chris, coming back to the question, you’ve got France and Germany and the devolved administrations in lockdown of a sort. Germany is going to lockdown, it’s got half as many new cases a day as us and a fraction of the number of deaths every day. Surely it’s just a matter of time isn’t it?
Chris Philp MP[0:43:54]Well, each country’s different, and we need to carefully balance the right approach for our country. Now, we have different parts…
Fiona Bruce[0:44:00]But surely… I know you’re not going to come on here tonight and say yes, we’re definitely going to introduce a lockdown, but anyone listening and looking at the graphs must be thinking it’s just a matter of time.
Chris Philp MP[0:44:12]Look, I think we have really different circumstances in different regions of the country. For example, the East of England only has one quarter the cases that the North West does. The world…
Fiona Bruce[0:44:19]But cases are rising everywhere.
