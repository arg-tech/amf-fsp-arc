Fiona Bruce[0:22:44] Grant, I know you want to come in. You've had a lot of time. I'm going to take a question from Colette Osborne.
Audience Member 6[0:22:54] Why not vaccine passports to allow businesses to ensure COVID safety when entering indoor venues?
Fiona Bruce[0:23:04] So you run a hair dressing salon, don't you, Colette? Is that what you would like.
Audience Member 7[0:23:14] I represent 11 hair salons across the country. Our normal practice is we are very safe, we are very clean. It is part of our training. If the government -- you know, we do need something like this. We're being told to have COVID safe certificates in our window, we're spending tens of thousands on all the PPE equipment. So, yes, actually, I think it is absolutely the right thing so we can protect the interests of our employees and our clients and people know they are going to a COVID-safe environment. Indoor is safer than outdoor, some indoor venues are on a medical basis. You can have people sitting cheek-to-cheek on a park bench, yet are we saying hospitals are not safe because they are indoors. There's all kinds of things here. But, absolutely, I think it is the right way to go.
