Robert Buckland[00:09:13] Don't lecture me about ordinary people.
Lisa Nandy[00:09:15] I will lecture you about that. It was laid bare today.
Robert Buckland[00:09:16] I was elected four times.
Lisa Nandy[00:09:18] It's disgraceful.
Robert Buckland[00:09:19] I was elected four times, and I've been elected four times in a town full of ordinary people, Swindon, which used to be a Labour seat. Now are you telling me that the people of Swindon are stupid or thick or wrong because they voted Conservative?
Lisa Nandy[00:09:31] No, I'm not…I'm not telling…
Robert Buckland[00:09:32] Because that's the message that's coming across from the Labour Party.
Lisa Nandy[00:09:34] Hang on a minute, are you telling…
Robert Buckland[00:09:35] You're insulting the voters and that's no way…
Lisa Nandy[00:09:37] Are you telling me that people in places like…
Robert Buckland[00:09:38] …that you're going to ever have a hope of power. You don't deserve it.
