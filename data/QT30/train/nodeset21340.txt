I however do worry about the Welsh Labour in particular flirting with Welsh nationalism, accommodating to it in a way that I found very unhelpful recently and not winning the arguments for the United Kingdom, and I do think that the union does count for something democratically. 

We've just talked about young people, by the way, young people are also going to be looking around at all the small new parties and some of them saying, you know, you've got Abolish, you've got Reform UK, you've got these parties that are basically not fitting in with the standard parties, and I think that therefore the Tories are overtrying with this mandating of the flag. I think they've got to win the arguments to get new voters rather than trying to force the union to work that way.
