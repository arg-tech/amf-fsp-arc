Jude Unknown[00:45:25] Thank you. Is the NHS in Scotland ready for the task ahead to meet the needs of our patients, including COVID rehabilitation?Fiona Bruce[00:45:35] Right, so Keith, I know you want to come back. Willie, I'm going to start with you. You've talked about drug deaths already, let's look at those in the NHS.Willie Rennie[00:45:41] So, at the core of this we've got a mountain of mental health needs, we've got a mountain of people who are waiting for their operations, their appointments. And what we need to do is to use some of the new technologies and new ways of working that we've developed through the pandemic, to make sure that we can deal with this backlog as quickly as possible. We've got two and a half billion pounds of extra funding that's going to be committed to the NHS over this period, and that means we'll have the finance.
