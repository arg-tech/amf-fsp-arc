Fiona Bruce[00:38:05] And, Devi, it's going to be done slightly differently in Scotland, because in Scotland the Scottish government is going to take over ticketing and timetabling and Great British Rail is going to take over the infrastructure. Is that going to be a better system? I mean, the government's saying the advantage of the system here in England and Wales is that you'll have one body, if you like, responsible for it all, and Scotland you're going to do things slightly differently.Professor Devi Sridhar[00:38:25] Yeah. I mean, I can't speak specifically to a Scottish versus English question, but I think the point I'd like to make is climate change is a huge problem and one of the only slightly positive things out of COVID has been reduction in air traffic which we know contributes to that, and I don't understand why it's so much cheaper and simpler to fly across the country than it is to take trains. So if the government's serious about climate change and about cutting down emissions, one of the simplest ways to subsidiseâ€¦because it's so expensive, it's much cheaper to fly than to take a train, and I just don't understand that right now because people will take trains but you have to make it easy and simple and cheap.
