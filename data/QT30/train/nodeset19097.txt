Fiona Bruce [00:55:08] We have little time left. I want to get around a few if I can. Lucas. Audience Speaker [00:55:14] I’m coming from a place where growing up in England, coming to a Scottish university, I was very pro the union. All my Scottish friends that I’ve made here at uni are all pro-independence. And on the point made that it’s important that we look for health and healing and ambitions and prosperity, seemingly what most of my friends say is the opportunities for Scotland outside of the United Kingdom, potentially being back in the European Union or making their own way, as the UK and Britain have said we’re going to do outside the union ourselves. Those opportunities are so much greater than if we’re stuck here in the United Kingdom and being consistently held back by Westminster that continues to prioritise London over any other part of the UK.
