Fiona Bruce[00:57:20] Okay, Christina, we hear you. I'm just going to cut in, sorry, because I've not got much time left and I've just got to let Richard here on the panel get a word in as well. Forgive me.

Richard Walker[00:57:29] No, it's absolutely heart breaking. It's also a complicated geopolitical issue with a lot of history and therefore I think at times like this as a humble shop keeper it's quite important to put your hands up and not profess to have any superior knowledge to what we all read in the papers or see on the TV. The one thing I have noticed however is potentially the one thing that unifies both sides is a disillusionment in the current political leadership and therefore one day the strong men will step aside or step down and lead to younger more progressive leaders who are more committed to a two state solution.
