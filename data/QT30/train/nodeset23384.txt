Fiona Bruce[0:29:58] Even if death continue, they are rising but very slowly -- if deaths continue at -- no one wants any deaths but if they continue at the relatively low level they are you would want to keep either face masks or social distancing.
Andy Burnham[0:30:12] I think I'm right in saying cases were highest day than they were in January. That's a worry. But you are right to say, Fiona, it isn't translating into hospitalisation. I was discussing the figures just before the show with David. So creeping up. There is a break between cases and hospital admission definitely. But I think the general point is if you get to the middle of July and say, okay, there's no masks, no distancing, the message coming out from the government will be we are back to normal. But I don't think we are back to normal. I think it is a case of living with this thing, as Benjamin was saying. So me, masks are a physical barrier to spreading the virus but a reminder that we are not living in normal time and we all need to look out for each other. I think that is a sensible way to go.
