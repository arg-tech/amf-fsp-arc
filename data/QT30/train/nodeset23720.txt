Now, I know Europe has its own issues with HGV drivers, but of course it's a bigger pool to fish from, and I think that will ease potentially the issue that I'm really quite worried about, as we start to run into Christmas, and also have to deal with all of the issuesâ€¦other issues that we're currently facing as an industry.Fiona Bruce[0:21:08] Munira.Munira Wilson[0:21:20] Well, I agree with a lot of what Richard said, and let's hope and pray we're not facing shortages this Christmas, but talking to some leaders in the industry this week, I understand that we are likely to have far less choice, and given the pressures because of the C02 shortage, the HGV driver crisis, we are already seeing prices going up, and as we've just been talking about, there are many families that are really going to struggle to make ends meet this Christmas.
