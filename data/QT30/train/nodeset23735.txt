Fiona Bruce[0:34:49] Okay, well listen, let's come back to the question. Do you agree the police should have extra powers to remove climate change protestors, so Grant, you have just managed to give the police extra powers, because you've got a temporary injunction to stop the protestors protesting on the M25 itself, nowhere else, is that enough? Are you going to go further? Are you happy with that?
Grant Shapps[0:35:08] Look, I am actually completely with the lady who asked the question. It is completely irresponsible, it is totally dangerous to walk onto a motorway. They're putting their own lives and the lives of people on the motorway at risk. It's counterproductive, because the traffic stands there causing the pollution they claim they care about, in the homes which turn out not to be insulated, and I cannot imagine why on earth anyone would think it was a good idea to step onto a motorway like that. That's why I asked National Highways, who run our motorways, to get hold of an injunction, which they did the other night. That injunction is now in place, but the reality is, that if we want to solve climate change, that is something that this government is passionate about doing. We're moving towards electric vehicles, we've got a transport decarbonisation, a plan for it, which no other country in the world has got. We've been decarbonising faster than any other country in the G7.
