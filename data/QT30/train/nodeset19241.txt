FIONA BRUCE [01:07:20] Rosie, we’re almost out of time but I wanted to give you the final word on that. [DONE]
ROSIE JONES [01:07:28] I think I’d kick myself without talking about the change between the DLA, Disability Living Allowance, to the Personal Independent Payment because 650,000 disabled people, including myself, got caught. And it just makes me insanely angry that I thought when I was assessed in 2008 that money that kept me going, that gave me support, it was taken off me. Luckily, I can work harder. I can push myself. But a lot of disabled people are now on the poverty line because they were assessed by a stranger for 10 minutes who would look at them and go: Oh, what do you need? That makes my blood boil. Yet I want to end it by going stop ignoring disabled people. We make up 22 percent of the population. We’re here and we’re worth listening to. [DONE]
FIONA BRUCE [01:09:42] Rosie, look at that. If the people here in this studio with us, you’d see the applause. You’d hear it. You can only see it.
