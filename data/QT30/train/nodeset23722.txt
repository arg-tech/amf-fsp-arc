AudienceMember 20210930QT10[0:23:08] Yeah, I'm just wondering if this is not a golden opportunity to think about more carbon neutral ways of transporting goods, you know, across country, continents et cetera.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:18] Not sure if we can get that up and running for Christmas, but…
AudienceMember 20210930QT11[0:23:20] No, no, but I mean long term.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:21] …long term, long term possibly. Yes, the man behind you in the striped shirt.
AudienceMember 20210930QT12[0:23:25] Thank you. You hear a lot of stories from lorry drivers who are leaving, saying that basically it's not fun anymore. Their working conditions have deteriorated over the last 20 years whereby there are far fewer places for them to go, they're restricted access areas, they are monitored in their cabs by cameras, they are penalised for being late. In the olden days, they used to be able to take their wives with them, now, you know, that's not allowed for insurance and things like that, and people are just finding it a really…it's being put in a way that makes their working conditions much harder for them and much more unenjoyable, so that's another reason why they're leaving.
