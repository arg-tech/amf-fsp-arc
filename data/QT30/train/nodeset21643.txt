AudienceMember 20210708QT03[0:05:28] Hi. Thank you. Yeah, I'm in total agreement with people who find it absurd that we have to wait for a Tory minister to do the honourable thing and resign. It is yet another example that Boris Johnson either has no conception of moral standards in public office or simply doesn't actually have the power to sack the people who aren't performing or who are ridden by scandals. I'm not sure which is more concerning.

AudienceMember 20210708QT04[0:06:02] I don't say this often but I think David hit the nail on the head there that Boris is treating this as an old boys' club. It is not an old boys' club, it is leading the nation. You put the people first. It is not at all what happened here. It is the tip of iceberg for me. I don't hugely care about this affair story. I care about him giving contracts to people who haven't gone through proper channels, giving jobs to friends and treating the public with blatant disregard. He should have been sacked the moment this came out.
