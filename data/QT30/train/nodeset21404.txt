Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:55:35] Now that there is a ceasefire I think the UK government really needs to redouble its efforts on two things. I think in the immediate term we need to get humanitarian aid into Gaza urgently and to be building the alliances around the international community for that to happen. Secondly then to continue with the pressure for a genuine peace process. There is no way forward in my view apart from a secure Israel that is safe in its borders and a viable state of Palestine, and I believe that the UK government must use its diplomatic weight now to achieve those two things.
