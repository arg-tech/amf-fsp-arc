Fiona Bruce[0:03:10] Michael.
Michael Forsyth[0:03:12] The first thing is we didn't have the vaccine and we didn't have the new variants which the scientific advice is that we should be very concerned about. So that is why the borders are being closed. But we are in the ridiculous situation where, in England, the borders are closed to people coming from "red" countries, whereas in Scotland it is coming from all countries.
Fiona Bruce[0:03:34] Where do you think it should be?
Michael Forsyth[0:03:38] I don't think it should be either. We should concentrate on getting the vaccine done as quickly as possible.
Fiona Bruce[0:03:46] But we should let anyone who wants to come in come in?
Michael Forsyth[0:03:50] In Scotland no one is allowed from any country whatsoever and where the transport minister was suggesting we should continue with this until the rest of the world is vaccinated. By then we will have trashed our economy and destroyed our industries. We have to balance the economic interests along with the health risks. That's a difficult decision. I think all politicians from all parties should support the government in what it is trying to do.
Fiona Bruce[0:04:18] We have a few hands up. Lindsay.
Audience Member[0:04:20] How can we stop someone landing in Heathrow Airport then renting a car and driving up to Scotland?
Fiona Bruce[0:04:28] John?
Audience Member[0:04:30] If we don't sort our health crisis, we're not going to be able to sort our economic crisis. Simple as that.
Fiona Bruce[0:04:38] Jim.
Audience Member[0:04:40] The Isle of Man locked down 25 March. They now have no social distancing, pubs are open, kids back at school. We are far too late and just completely wrong.
Fiona Bruce[0:04:56] You think we should close the borders to all countries?
Audience Member[0:05:00] I don't understand how 600,000 people a month can be coming into this country on business.
