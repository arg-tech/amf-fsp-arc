[Anya]: I think it is important we keep hospitality places open. Especially students using things like this to get through college and university, it is hard when you are not making that money. It has had a knock-on effect for the employees who work there. I think it is bit -- it is something you have to work on. So so long as they’re doing their bit and keeping it well-ventilated and following guidelines. It is a bit like school. Schools are open, we’re all socialising in big numbers. If we can do that at school, it’s had a big effect on hospitality by shutting down those places. 
Liam Halligan [00:36:06] As I said, the hospitality sector employs 10 percent of the workforce. It doesn’t give me any pleasure to say it but we’re facing a tsunami of unemployment here. With the best will in the world even though the vaccine is well on the way, Amen to that, we could have another six months of lockdown. I personally think we need to be smarter about how we lockdown. Locking us down by region is too much of a blunt instrument. Look at the case of Kent where you have high infections on the Medway towns but in rural Kent some of the lowest infection rates in the country. The Covid recovery group pushed the prime minister to say he wants to be more granular, breaking down regions into particular areas so that country pub where our resident scientist says there really is no danger so long as it is well-ventilated, that’s a family with their house, their mortgage, the life savings on the line, and Tom is nodding from the waist. So we have to help businesses get through what could be another six months of this. We can offer more help, we want to see that, but we’re borrowing £400 billion this year -- in a single year. This is outlandish amounts of money. There has to be a limit to throwing money at a situation. It’s costing us £1 billion a day.
