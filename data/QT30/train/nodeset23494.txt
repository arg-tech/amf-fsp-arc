Paul Scully[0:42:32] I agree that it's, you know, again the optics of people flying into Glasgow is not particularly good, but what you do find --Fiona Bruce[0:42:40] And the prime minister flying in a private jet to a dinner in London.Paul Scully[0:42:46] What you find is not so much what's happening in that hall, it's what's happening with the negotiating teams alongside those informal meetings. When China are not here, for example, there is a high-level negotiating team from China that's over here.Fiona Bruce[0:43:04] So do you think -- the question, basically, is it going to be a success or more blah blah blah? I know we are only part way through it, at the moment is it looking a success.Paul Scully[0:43:14] I'm optimistic. There's plenty more to be done, clearly. The prime minister is talking about coal, cars, cash and trees. All those need to be looked at. Whether it is deforestation, whether making sure we have 450 of the top financial companies in the world that are aligning their funds, trillions of pounds, dollars worth of funds along with the climate change, the US climate change targets. So this is a really important market change. But what it is also doing is developing and creating markets. Tim talked about the cost to the consumer, but the government money and the government strategies that we have also leveraged private money. So the hydrogen strategy is bringing in money to this country because they know the government are backing a particular technology and that can start to be developed.
