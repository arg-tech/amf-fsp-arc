Fiona Bruce [00:23:52] This presumably is taking a toll on you. Rachel Clarke [00:23:56] Absolutely. Today we have had the devastating news this afternoon that we have reached a truly world beating and bleak in the extreme milestone. Today, in the last 24-hours, over 1,000 people have lost their lives to COVID. Now that’s more than every single person who has died in Australia of COVID has died in their entire pandemic. We have lost more than the entire Australian death toll in 24-hours. Conditions in hospitals are unimaginable. We have ambulances queuing up outside, patients we can’t get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&amp;E is full. Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically ill COVID patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. That is how bad things are. How -- how could the government have allowed things to get so bad? SAGE told the government in September to have a circuit breaker. They told the government before Christmas: You have to lock down. And Boris Johnson ignored it because he is pathologically incapable of making a difficult decision. And that is reprehensible.[DONE]
