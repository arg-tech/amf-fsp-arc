Bernadine Evaristo [00:06:59] Well, I think we need to have that conversation, probably. But, there is also this argument that’s come up, in terms of the statues, that we can’t change history and that it is the history of this country. But actually, history is a construction. Okay, events happen, we have a past, and then historians contextualise that past and interrogate it. And what’s happened in this country, is that historically that has been done by elite white men, who have been the historians, who have set the framework for the events of the past. So, history is something that needs to be challenged, and re-interrogated, and revised constantly.And removing those statues, in a sense it’s giving power to the people who really do object to a symbol of their historical slavery and all their allies as well. The other thing about history, is that history has always excluded primarily women and people of colour, and working class people and LGBTQ+ people, in the ways in which it’s been told. And that also goes to what you were saying about the colonial history.
