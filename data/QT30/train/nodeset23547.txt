Fiona Bruce[00:13:14] Heather, let me bring you in now. Should governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?
Heather McGregor[00:13:18] Personally, I would like less restrictions, actually, because I'm sitting here in a room with 60 people in a university lecture theatre. I'm not allowed to do that at the moment, actually, at work. I can't teach a class of more than 50 people. This would not be allowed. And what I would like to see is all of the correct precautions that we're taking in Scotland, I think are very good, masks in public places, we enforce that everywhere in the university. But unlike in England, we are not allowed to teach people in larger groups yet, even with social distancing. And so I would like to see that change. You've got to remember that education in Scotland, Higher Education in Scotland, it generates millions and millions of pounds and lots and lots of jobs. And so we have people coming from all over the world who actually this time have come back to Scotland, they've chosen to study in Scotland, and they can't actually come to class because we don't at the moment have the same rules as England. But this virus is with us, as was said by Brian. This is going to be not normal life again forever. We are going to have to live with this for the rest of our lives. We need to find a way to work with it, and I for one would welcome fewer restrictions.
