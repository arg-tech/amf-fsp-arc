Ian Blackford[0:40:12] As the gentleman just said, the vast majority, the vast, vast majority of our police force are decent people trying to conduct a public service. I want to applaud them for what they do day in, day out. But we can't walk away from this.Fiona Bruce[0:40:30] In terms of police Scotland, attitudes haven't changed as much as they should have since 1999, what can you do as the Scottish government to change that.Ian Blackford[0:40:40] Of course this needs to be addressed in the Scottish Parliament when it relates to Scotland, as far as Westminster is concerned, we have the Select Committee, they have an important role to play in this. We need to make sure as politicians that we are doing everything that we can to ensure that the public can feel safe, that they can trusted the police force. But it is not just these issues. We have had the long-running saga over Hillsborough. It holds us all back. We have to make sure that collectively we work with the police force, wherever it is, to deal with these situations and rebuild the public trust and confidence. It is too important that we do that. And we have to do it on a consensual basis.Fiona Bruce[0:41:26] The question is can we trust the police.Mark Harper[0:41:30] I think one thing you do as a Member of Parliament you do engage a lot with the police in, like a normal way where you are not either having suffered some traumatic event or been caught by them or whatever. You gain with them a lot.
