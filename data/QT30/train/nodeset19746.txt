Nadhim Zahawi [00:07:08] Can I just say briefly, we’ve done 1.3 million vaccinations, a quarter of the over 80s I mentioned. Between 4 and 11 January you are going to see another step-up because the NHS plan and the rollout that has been delivered in a methodical way -- 
Fiona Bruce [00:07:30] What kind of numbers? 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:07:32] Our target is to get to the 13.89 million. I can’t give you the numbers. 
Fiona Bruce [00:07:38] You must know what you’re aiming for. 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:07:40] Of course. But the data release is tomorrow and then from next week every single day the prime minister wants to, every day, say the data of everybody we vaccinated. 
Mark Walport [00:07:54] Clearly we’re in a race between getting people vaccinated and the new more transmissible variant. The numbers speak for themselves. The reality is that the supply of vaccine is limited at the moment so we need the maximum amount of protection from the doses of the vaccine that we’ve got. So the reality is that the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech is about 70 percent protection, it is reckoned, and Pfizer -- sorry, the AstraZeneca one is 70 percent and Pfizer/BioNTech is about 90 percent. If you can give it to 2,000 people and get that protection, then it makes sense to prolong it for 12 weeks. So long as people get the second dose, then it isn’t critical whether you get it quickly or a bit later in terms of getting the secondary immune response. So this has been looked at very carefully. There’s no doubt it isn’t perfect, but the situation here is the perfect may be the enemy of the good and what we need to do is get the maximum protection for the maximum number of people. Under those circumstances, I think most people who are immunologists, who are vaccine experts, and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation have looked at the data, so not perfect but probably the right thing to do under the circumstances where the vaccine is limited.[DONE]
