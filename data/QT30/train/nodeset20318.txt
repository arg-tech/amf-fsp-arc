Fiona Bruce[0:27:42] You supported Brexit. Would you not have supported the same argument to the UK as a whole?Stephen Fitzpatrick[0:27:50] One of the reasons I supported Brexit was I became very interested in homelessness. I saw a real challenge with homelessness but social equality in general as being part of a nation of 28 nations with open borders, some of which have an income 80 percent less than the UK. We should, by the way, provide every homeless person with somewhere to sleep, but then find that applies to potentially 500 million people. So that was some very specific reasons why I voted for Brexit. I thought economically we would be worst off but socially more cohesive. I think over the shorter term, I genuinely, hand on heart, if Scotland say they want to go for independence, I will be sad but I will be supportive and optimistic, but this is a decision that will affect this generation and future generations and children and people not even born for decades and hundreds of years. What is the rush? Right now every nation around the world is trying to figure out how on earth they are going to recover from this economic and social disaster, and with 250,000 children living in poverty, I cannot understand this is the time. But, that said, if this is the time, then I think it is for the Scottish people to decide.
