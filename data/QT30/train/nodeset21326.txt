Michelle Dewberry[00:47:05] I am old enough to…yeah, I'm going to come to that, don't you worry. I am old enough to remember Blockbuster video, and when you wanted to set up an account there…Fiona Bruce[00:47:14] Okay, who here remembers Blockbuster video? We all do, come on, Michelle.Michelle Dewberry[00:47:17] You had to show you are who you say you are. I find it beyond backward that you can go to a polling station, walk up to the lady or the man or whoever on the desk and they have in front of them a list of names and addresses and any old random, let's face it, because half the time you can see the list, because I've been there on polling days as a candidate watching how they do things, any old random can wander up and say, oh yeah, I'm Joe Smith from so and so, and in you go with no verification whatsoever. So if you need to prove ID to pick up letters and borrow this, borrow that, you absolutely should prove that you are who you say you are, if you want to influence the direction that this country is going to be governed in. Now, a couple of key caveats to that. All of this talk about discrimination, if people haven't got access already to photographic ID, you must make it free to access photographic ID. If you started talking to me about charging people to access this card, I'll be dead against it, point number one.
