Audience Speaker [00:22:20] When is a café a restaurant and a restaurant a bar? Does it differ in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast or London? Fiona Bruce [00:22:28] I have been looking at the regulation. Let’s take a café, for example. You can sit down and eat in a café in Edinburgh but only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. They close at 10 p.m. in London and in Cardiff and shut all together in Belfast. Mark, do you want to kick us off with this? Mark Walport [00:22:48] Yes, sure. The first thing to say is that this virus transmits in indoor spaces more easily than it does in the outside. The second thing is that, going back to the last question, the numbers aren’t going down because we’re on average making too many social contacts. So we know that lockdown works because when this pandemic started with tight restrictions it did come under control. Restaurants, cafés, it depends, actually, how people are seated. It depends how people behave, whether they are inside or outside. I think that when you read through, and I read through before coming, all the different restrictions, I looked at Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, it is very confusing, and it is different. The bottom line is we need to reduce our social contacts, and until we get it down similar to the levels we started with, this is not going to come under control. Frankly, we do need to get on top of the second wave and urgency does matter. So we just have to get on with it and I don’t think it is helpful having lots of different hard-to-understand rules.
