Fiona Bruce[0:44:10] You don't think there was a shortage?

Tony Danker[0:44:14] I think there was a shortage by definition because there wasn't enough in the place it needed to be all the time. This is like stocking supermarkets across the country. We're going to need 1 million loaves of bread and we'll spread this to them. You need 2 million if there's going to be a million bought. I'm sorry, it's a much more boring answer, but what's going on here is people are sitting centrally saying we have enough stock for what the country needs but that doesn't mean every hospital has enough supply. To Jeremy's point about the vaccine, what we have now is an oversupply of vaccine. We have people at the end of the day who are trying to get rid of vaccines with volunteers. What we didn't have with PPE, it seems to me, is the necessary oversupply of PPE. So it is disingenuous to say mathematically that we have enough. If you haven't enough in every part of the country, you haven't got enough. I think this might be a maths story rather than anything too much more sinister than that.
