Fiona Bruce[0:34:00] Madeline, you wanted to come back in.
Madeline Grant[0:34:04] I agree with that point, but with variants there has been a tendency to get panicky about a new variant without the grounds for doing so. I think we should deal with the risk that we currently face, not the possible nebulous risk, which I agree is scary, of a new variant coming in which is resistant to all the vaccines. Until we have evidence of that we need to, with the world as we currently have it not on until eventualiality.
Benjamin Zephaniah[0:34:34] I may have sounded heavy when I was talking about the evolution of seeing any of them, and the way we treat animals. But I teach at a university, young adults, and I teach performance poetry. I've had to do it on Zoom this year. It was absolutely terrible. I mean it worked because we had to do it to make it work for Zoom, but it wasn't like teaching in the class. I really want to get back into the classroom. But I've seen the stress on some of my students. I know in other universities and some schools where there have been suicide with kids that can't cope. But in all the answers I've heard people saying, people keep talking about going back to normal. Okay, I'm not going to be heavy, but normal got us here. You know, if you make a mistake, there's nothing wrong with making a mistake, but it is about making the mistake again and again and again. We have to change the way we do things. I just think it seems obvious and nobody is saying it. Everybody is saying "back to normal, back to normal". Normal got us here.
