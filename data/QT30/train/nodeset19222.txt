FIONA BRUCE [00:40:30] Merryn, as far as business is concerned, this is the timeframe they desperately need. When will businesses be able to open up and operate normally again? MERRYN SOMERSET [00:40:40] This is a game-changer, the knowledge that there will be a vaccine by the spring and let’s say most vulnerable people and older people have been vaccinated by late spring, etcetera, they think I’m sure the entire economy could open up properly. If businesses know that they can move out of this appalling cycle of not knowing what’s going to happen, hyper regulatory activity, lockdown this, curfew this, rules all over the place, up down, up down, not knowing where they are, if they can look forward to a future that is linear, where things don’t change all the time, then they can start moving their businesses around to make them work again. In that sense it is an absolutely game-changer for business. That’s why you saw these astonishing moves in the stock market on Monday when you saw, effectively all the companies geared into the return of normal life, airlines, pubs, etcetera, go completely -- and all the stocks geared into the nightmare we live now, working from home, etcetera, fall significantly. So the economy will be able to look forward to something more linear, less alcoholic beverage.
