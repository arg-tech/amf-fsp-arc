Fiona Bruce[00:10:54] Jamie?
Jamie Unknown[00:10:56] Just to pick up on a point that Andrew RT Davies mentioned then, we're still seeing holidays being advertised on the television so have the Welsh Government shared this information that it's unlikely that international travel is going to happen? Because it's giving false hope and the industry are looking to survive. For me personally, I'm happy to stay at home for a staycation and support local businesses to get back on their feet, I'm not looking to go around the world, but surely this lack of a roadmap and telling the holiday companies not to advertise on TV and not to go to the expense and everything else, why hasn't the Welsh Government shared this information early with the holiday companies and the travel agencies? 
Fiona Bruce[00:11:42] Well, the decision to travel abroad is a UK Government policy.
