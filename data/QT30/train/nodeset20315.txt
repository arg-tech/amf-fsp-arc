Ian Murray[0:15:56] Why was this not done a year ago? For all the things that are said, it should have been done earlier.
Fiona Bruce[0:16:06] Let's hear from the audience.
Audience Member[0:16:08] I do understand the balancing act, it is a delicate balancing act between the economy and health, but we've known for a long time the virus is spread very quickly with the movement of people and between people. So it is almost like the government is playing Russian roulette with people's health. We are too slow. I think that will damage the economy more than anything else.Fiona Bruce[0:16:34] I'm going to -- we could talk about this all evening. I'm going to move on, take another question from Iain.Audience Member[0:16:40] If the SNP get a majority in May, what right do the Tories have to deny Scottish diplomacy withholding a referendum on independence?Fiona Bruce[0:16:52] Angela?Angela Haggerty[0:16:56] If the SNP get a majority in May then the Tories don't have any authority to deny a second independence referendum, but I have to point out that we've already been in this situation. The SNP has won so many elections since 2014 and somewhere in its manifesto it always had the reference to the second independence referendum. So we're already in a state where we have the Conservative government and even if it was a Labour Government saying they are going to block a second referendum because now is not the time.
