Collette Unknown[00:14:41] Thank you, Fiona. Hello panel. Did the government fail by not closing borders to India when they had the chance?
Fiona Bruce[00:14:46] Nadhim.
Nadhim Zahawi[00:14:49] Collette, so we put India on the red list on 23 April, a full six days before the scientists, the virologists actually said that the B1617.2 variant is a variant under investigation, and a full two weeks before it became a variant of concern. If you are travelling from a red list country you have to go into hotel quarantine, you have to do three tests, a pre-departure test, a test after two days, test after eight days. If you are travelling from an amber country you have to do three tests pre-departure, two and eight, and quarantine for ten days as well.
Fiona Bruce[00:15:28] No, hang on, we're talking about India specifically.
Nadhim Zahawi[00:15:32] Yes, andâ€¦
Fiona Bruce[00:15:33] Just to understand this. On 3 April when Bangladesh and Pakistan were placed on the red list their seven day daily case averages were 33 per million and 21 per million respectively. India's was 53 per million, so why were they not put on the red list then?
Nadhim Zahawi[00:15:48] So I was about to complete the answer to say that we can only act on the evidence that we have.
Fiona Bruce[00:15:52] But that's pretty good evidence, isn't it?
