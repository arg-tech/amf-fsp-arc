FIONA BRUCE [00:32:08] Before you answer that, can I see if there’s anyone in our audience who is hesitating about taking the vaccine, who isn’t that sure about it. Kay.[DONE] KAY UNKNOWN [00:32:22] Matt, hi. I’m concerned because I don’t believe there has been adequate time to put the vaccine through the rigorous testing that we would expect it to go through before being given to the general public. What do you say on that? FIONA BRUCE [00:32:36] Ellie? ELLIE UNKNOWN [00:32:38] I would agree with Kay, especially when you look at previous things like thalidomide, things like that. Thalidomide. Are the side affects that could come along with the vaccine? FIONA BRUCE [00:32:54] Jay, I know you had reticence about taking the vaccine as well. JAY UNKNOWN [00:32:58] Yeah, I have to say, I do agree with Matt completely because we’re in an unknown -- there’s going to be a lot of unknowns coming up, but staying positive, looking to the future. During the start of the pandemic we got all the volunteers applied to help out. If that can happen again who knows what would happen.
