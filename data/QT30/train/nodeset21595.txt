Sarah Jones[0:33:24] Daniel's father lives in my constituency. I've been talking to him, as you imagine. 34 years on from the murder of his father we have some light shone on what's happened. The report is, to be clear, incredibly damning, it really is both of the Home Office, and the Met Police and the whole structure around with, you know, the way that all these inquiries operated. It talks of a form of institutional corruption. I was disappointed this week with the Home Secretary's response. We were in Parliament asking questions. I asked her if she would come back before the summer recess to let us know what she would do about this because she didn't accept any of the findings, she hasn't given a commitment to put in my findings.
Fiona Bruce[0:34:14] The question is can we trust the Met?
Sarah Jones[0:34:20] I would absolutely support the police and trust the police. They've worked incredibly hard over the last year, they have had a hard time and not much thanks for it.
Fiona Bruce[0:34:30] So when the commissioner says "I do not accept that we are are insti criticisms of her, what do you make of that?
Sarah Jones[0:34:40] She says she is going to come back with a proper response. For her, she needs to show the leadership that we understand serious mistakes have happened and we need to put it right. My concern looking forward, this has spanned 30 years so it is not just Cressida that has been in charge that whole period, but the Met is a young workforce.
