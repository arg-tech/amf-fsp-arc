Jo Unknown[00:11:02] Firstly, Paul, oatmeal drinking latte people, I mean, what planet are you on? I consider myself to be as equal to anybody else that's working class, I work bloomin' hard, I pay my bills and I look after my own affairs. Lisa, your behaviour just completely depicts why people don't want to vote Labour, because all you've done is point the finger and throw stones at anybody who dares to question you. I amâ€¦this is why I really would not put my vote on your Labour ballot paper, because this is exactly what we get, exactly what we get. Conservatives are no better, but do you know what, I am just sick to the back teeth of hearing you whinge on at every other person who criticises you, sick of it.
Fiona Bruce[00:11:52] Rose?
Rose Unknown[00:11:55] Yes, I have voted Labour all my life and this is the first time this past election I had to seriously sit down and think about whether I would vote Labour. The majority of my life has been in Tory government and what I do know for sure is I do not want it to continue to be a Tory government. But isn't Labour the natural division between it now, I don't think it is, and that's because it's lost its heart. The previous leader had heart and you could believe in him.
