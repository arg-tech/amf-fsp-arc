[FIONA BRUCE] : Anthony. 
[ANTHONY COSTELLO] : Well, eviction is a disaster for families and for children. I was astonished to find that 90,000 children in London live in temporary accommodation. And the effects that will have on their families, on their education, and the rest. So in the short term we need long notice periods, debt renegotiation, and interest-free loans. I agree with Heather about keeping a rental sector going. But I think in the medium term we need architects and builders to be coming up with much more low cost, affordable housing, maybe using newer pre-fabricated technologies which build quickly, which are low carbon, which are environmentally friendly. I think we can solve this problem alongside progressive policies to ensure that people don't lose their homes.
