Nick Ferrari[0:37:40] That must take as well.
Fiona Bruce[0:37:42] When the head of Next is suggesting bringing people in, but paying them the same. He is suggesting bringing people in as paying them the same as British workers.
Nadhim Zahawi[0:37:54] You have got to be pragmatic about it, the way we increased the seasonal workers...
Minette Batters[0:38:04] The sector has a requirement for 80,000 seasonal workers.
Nadhim Zahawi[0:38:10] I hear you, you've got to calibrate which is your point because as we want to transition the economy to a high wage, high skill economy as Wheelmore are doing. I spoke to one of the big distribution centres in Manchester, they're going from a warehouse with no automation to a warehouse with automation, but higher skills and higher wages because they're going to work with robots. That's the economy we want to see because they deserve higher skills and higher wages. My focus in my department is that by the end of this Parliament, we have a skills agenda that does deliver. We started off with apprenticeships under David Cameron and 2.5 billion into apprenticeships in the UK. We have a Skills Bill and it is about upskilling and reskilling. If you told me under Cameron that we would have a Prime Minister that would deliver a policy that at any time you can pull off modules and upskill and reskill, I would have bitten your arm off. Boris Johnson is delivering that in the lifetime skills guarantee.
