Mark Walport [00:47:28] It is worth saying on the news this evening that the average age of people in intensive care is 60. 
Rachel Clarke [00:47:36] That’s what we’re seeing as well.
Mark Walport [00:47:38] So you are a long way off. 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:47:42] Which is why I said the nine categories. 
Fiona Bruce [00:47:44] You said we could do the maths. Just do it for us. When do you think you will get to the end of the 9 categories? 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:47:50] My target is mid February for the first cohort. I’m happy to come back. We are going to be publishing daily numbers so the nation can see where we’re at as we increase. We will do it as soon as possible but I’m hoping the 9 categories by spring will be done. 
Rachel Clarke [00:48:06] Please may I ask a simple question, I would love a simple answer. This is a question on behalf of all those teachers in and out of schools now, but all teachers who will be going back into schools when this lockdown is lifted. Can you, please, on behalf of the teaching profession, tonight guarantee that when this lockdown is lifted and when teachers go back into schools they will all have received a vaccination. 
Nadhim Zahawi [00:48:38] The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, this came up earlier, on BAME cohorts looking at all different cohorts, key workers, BAME people, they decided very clearly those that are most vulnerable are the nine categories they set us because age is the predictor, back to Mark’s point and SAGE, of COVID. When we do phase 1, teachers are right up there in terms of first in line. Some of them will be vulnerable and will be in phase 1 of the nine cohorts, but to be able to protect the most vulnerable and the frontline NHS workers and social care, we have to follow the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.
