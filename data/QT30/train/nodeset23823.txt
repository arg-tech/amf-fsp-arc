Fiona Bruce[0:34:42] So the question from Sam is with high casualties, both civilian and military, what was the war in Afghanistan for? The lady in the red T-shirt.
AudienceMember 20210902QT28[0:34:52] (23) As one who deployed to Afghanistan about with the British military, I saw first hand some of the benefits of us being there and some of the negatives. I think at the time we knew we were not there to make a radical change to the situation in Afghanistan, but I think we could all hold our heads up high and say that we were seeing green shoots emerging, be that women's education, be that people in Afghanistan being able to live a peaceful and secure, and prosperous life. With the recent events, which I don't think have particularly come as a shock to anyone, those green shoots are now stone dead. The Afghans that I supported, I've heard have been executed in cold blood, the people that I served with, and who served on previous tours, who have lost friends, brothers, sons, sisters, are now seriously questioning what it was all for, and honestly, the only way that I can feel like I cannot be utterly embarrassed and humiliated about my service is if we as a democratic nation hold those responsible to this for account and have a full parliamentary inquiry that Boris Johnson is trying to weasel out of having, trying to pretend that we don't need one, where it holds to account both some of the political decisions, but also those in the military hierarchy who were responsible for strategic and operational decisions that have led to failure.
