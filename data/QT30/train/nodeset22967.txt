Fiona Bruce [00:11:38] It is pretty simple. No question of there being checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. So he was wrong there. He’s not right, is he? 
Brandon Lewis [00:11:50] The the point we made Northern Ireland businesses will have unfettered access as part of the UK. That the protocol does deliver. From products move from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, particularly with SPS checks --

Brandon Lewis [00:12:12] I’ll let you pronounce that bit. But also because we recognise and we have done for a long time the single epidemiological unit of the island of Ireland. There have been checks since the 19th century. That’s what we built on. We have built on that for those kind of products. Now this is partly to ensure that Northern Ireland businesses and Great Britain actions moving products to Northern Ireland staying in Northern Ireland get to do that tariff free. Obviously we have to make sure that they have that ability, unlike goods that may be moving to the Republic of Ireland where tariffs would apply.
