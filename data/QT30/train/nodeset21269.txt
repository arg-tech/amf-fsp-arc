They've stripped money out of our communities while telling them they're going to level them up, they say they'll invest in our people and then they cut nurses' pay. They say they'll fix social care and then we have a Queen's speech where they failed to do it. It is not good enough. When it comes to the crunch, when they are asked to make big major decisions they are not on the side of the those communities.
