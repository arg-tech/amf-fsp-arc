My worry about this, though, is I tend to agree with the Scottish government's position, we should stop travel from everywhere, rather than just red zones, but my fear about this is it falls into the politicisation that we've seen a few times so it all becomes about borders, then it becomes about politics and about the constitution, and it doesn't become about public health. That should be at the forefront of everybody's minds and I would really urge politicians to make sure that they don't fall down that hole because that's really not what the public is looking for.

The thing I get more than anything else is the sense of fear that the public has now. I look back to where we were in March last year, what we were asked to do, the plan was to flatten the curve, protect the NHS, slowly but surely we have shifted this goalposts to what's expected. I have to say I understand why so many people have this sense of fear because of what they hear from the media, from politicians and so on. I also understand why people feel to strongly about the border issue.
