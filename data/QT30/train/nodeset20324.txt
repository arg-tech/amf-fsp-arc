Michael Forsyth[0:35:18] If you want to have another referendum you at the very least should spell out how we'd survive. What would happen to people's pensions? How would we pay their pensions? How would you pay your share of the debt which is now enormous? There's going to be half a trillion pounds of debt. It is just fantasy politics and fantasy economics to think that you are going to risk the future of Scotland by shearing yourself away from the strength of the United Kingdom around you.
Jeane Freeman[0:35:50] What I don't really understand is why, in the face of the 21 polls that show that a majority -- increasing majority of people in Scotland want not only a referendum but to be independent, an SNP --
Michael Forsyth[0:36:08] That's because you keep telling them lies about the consequences.
Jeane Freeman[0:36:12] People in Scotland are not daft. They know when they are being told lies. It is disrespectful to say such a thing. What we've said, and it isn't actually a referendum or election, the SNP and other parties will take a prospectus to the electorate that will be more than about referendum and independence, but the basic fact is the people of Scotland should have the democratic right to choose whether or not they want a referendum. If they do, if they do, then we'll have all these arguments on both sides.
