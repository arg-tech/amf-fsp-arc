Nadhim Zahawi[0:20:40] We announced £3,000 in bonuses for teachers in maths, physics and chemistry to those schools who need them most because those children have talent, they don't have opportunity. That's what we're doing.
Nick Ferrari[0:21:08] Nadhim, there was no shortage of wind in Manchester and there is no shortage of wind here tonight in Aldershot with you. Let's be honest, is that a valid argument that the temporary uplift in Universal Credit has to be addressed? Yes. Why for the love of all that's holy, as these folk are looking and winter is running in and we look at our thermostats nervously, why would your party do it then and why couldn't you graduate it to help those people who need it most?
Nadhim Zahawi[0:21:44] Nick, we announced as we arrived in Manchester, £0.5 billion for exactly those people...
Nick Ferrari[0:21:50] Why aren't they getting it?
Nadhim Zahawi[0:21:52] On helping if they need additional help with food or anything else, through Local Government and if you're going to criticise us on something, admit that we've done something about it for the most needy.
Fiona Bruce[0:22:02] Okay, I'm going to move on and take another question. I just want to tell you that we will be in Nottingham next week. After that we're in Glasgow where we will be joined by the actor and the star of the HBO television drama, Succession, Brian Cox. Lisa is excited.
