Kate Andrews[0:54:55] Yeah, it's great that now we can use remote contact with GPs to get a new prescription or deal with something very small, but that isn't really the point here. I'm pleased that we've moved into a world where that's possible, but the point is that for 18 months, patients have more or less been put off going to the NHS. It got so bad at the end of last year that the NHS had to come up with its own slogans to try to recruit people back to the NHS because we were worried about capacity, for understandable reasons, but it has meant that so many people have gone missed, over five million people now in England on these waiting lists, and if we owe any group of people anything, it is those who are sick and vulnerable and who did not get seen in a good amount of time, to be able to get all of the access to the care that they need now. And that has to start with being able to see your GP.
