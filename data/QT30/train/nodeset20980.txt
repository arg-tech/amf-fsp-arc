Douglas Ross[00:05:54] Well, the question from Blair was about independence, which is why I answered about independence. But we hear from Emma, a former SNP supporter, saying she won't support the party now because they're putting independence above our recovery. What I'm saying as a Scottish Conservative is, we can stop that, we can stop the uncertainty and focus on jobs…
Fiona Bruce[00:06:12] Okay, you've made that point.
Douglas Ross[00:06:13] …focus on recovery, focus on education, all the things we want to focus on in the next parliament.
Fiona Bruce[00:06:16] Willie?
Willie Rennie[00:06:16] Yeah, I mean, this country has been bitterly divided for, what, ten years now with arguments over independence, then over Brexit and we've been through one hell of a year with the pandemic.
