Fiona Bruce[00:27:35]. Okay. Craig?Craig Unknown[00:27:36] Yeah, I think there's two points I would make, the first one being that there's 72 MSPs have been sworn in today who support independence, so I think it's a bit naïve to say that there isn't a majority in the Scottish Parliament to proceed. The second point is that the whole argument around Boris Johnson being able to say whether or not he thinks we should have an independence referendum, I think ultimately he's going to have to go ahead with it, because that's how democracy works. And I think to do anything differently would be…the whole world is watching and we have to be democratic in respect of the Scottish people that voted.Fiona Bruce[00:28:21] Chris?Chris Unknown[00:28:24] Interesting that there is so much talk about what is democratic. The number of people who actually voted in the Scottish elections, who voted for SNP, comes to something like 2.5 per cent of the total population of the UK. Now that is not a democratic figure for saying that they should have the right to break up the union. Forty-nine per cent is not a total majority and even if you were assuming that every single person who voted for the SNP was in favour of independence you still don't have a majority.
