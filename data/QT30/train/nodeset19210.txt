SPEAKER: My question is how many people need to have the vaccine for it to be successful. Now we heard there are going to be vaccines before the end of the year but significantly less than we neat need. How many people need to be vaccinated for it to be successful. 

MATT HANCOCK [00:13:30] The honest truth to that question is we don’t yet know. It is one of the many things we don’t yet know about the vaccine. The reason for that is in the trials that the vaccines, you test for how effective they are protecting the individual, also how safe they are. If they are safe and effective we can start to roll them out. The early data from the Pfizer vaccine looks like it is 90 percent effective protecting individuals. [DONE] That’s great. So if -- if -- it passes the safety data, and that is a big hurdle it still hasn’t gone over, then we can start rolling it out and it starts protecting people as soon as they’ve -- a week or so after the second dose
