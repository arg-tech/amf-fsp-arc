Bonnie Greer[0:15:41]Chris, that’s what they used to say, the folks, when they were desegregating a neighbourhood, oh, well, we have a black person here in our neighbourhood so we’re cool, we’re all right. That doesn’t wash anymore. Okay. You don’t judge people like that anymore. We look at human beings. Baroness Warsi has been on you…not you personally, but on the Conservative party, her party for years about this. This does not excuse or wash over the Labour party. I’m not doing that. But there is housework you need to be doing too, and putting people of colour in the cabinet does not erase that fact.Marie van der Zyl[0:16:22]Can I just…?Fiona Bruce[0:16:23]Yes, go ahead. Then we must bring Anthony in.Marie van der Zyl[0:16:26]Absolutely. I just want to say, look, the Tories do need to acknowledge there is a problem with Islamophobia in the Tory party, and they do acknowledge they need to do something about it. The Board of Deputies did input into the Singh report, but you’ve got to look at scale here. The BNP have also been investigated by the EHRC. But so many people in the Labour party have been investigated. You’re not seeing from the Conservative party MPs fleeing from the party, like Luciana Berger, a pregnant woman at the Labour party conference. She even had to have security. Louise [inaudible 0:17:05], she had to flee the party after 55 years. So you’re not seeing the same level of scale, even though there are problems that have to be addressed in the Conservative party.
