Sarah Jones[0:20:42] Not the over 50s.
Mark Harper[0:20:48] Some people haven't had it. The first dose about transmission, if you read what the government said yesterday, we're not going to vaccinate these younger people until August because there's a supply issue. My worry is the week before 19 July we're going to see the same scientists being wheeled out, the ones on the stage, but all speak in a personal capacity. There's going to be a drum beat again and, once again, it is going to be put off. Worse, in the winter -- and there are government internal documents talking about the autumn and winter and the pressure on the NHS, we're going to see the pressure to introduce restrictions and do this all over again. It will destroy businesses and confidence across the country. At some point we have got to learn to live with this virus, uncomfortable though it is, I think we should have started that process on 21 June.
Fiona Bruce[0:21:46] Ian, you have been researching through all this.

Ian Blackford[0:21:52] We had 128,000 deaths. If Mark and his colleagues had got their way then the death rate in this country will increase.

Mark Harper[0:22:04] I'm sorry, that's not right.
