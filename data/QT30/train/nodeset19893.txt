Fiona Bruce [00:19:22] Sorry. Sorry. I just want to let Arlene in. You heard what Arlene said about hitching your wagon to the wrong horse. Also the question for the audience. Do you regret now not going for the Theresa May deal, ending up with a protocol you don’t like? Arlene Foster [00:19:42] The Theresa May deal and the backstop envisaged in that, in the words of the attorney-general, would have been with us together. At least with have an opportunity to debate that in four years’ time. The Theresa May deal left us in the EU customs union. At the moment we’re in the United Kingdom customs area. So, I mean, I think that is important to say that. The Theresa May deal, and I know people have talked about this, including George Osborne over this period of time, but the reality is Theresa May couldn’t even convince her own party to go with her deal never mine the Democratic Unionist Party. So it is important to say that it would have left us in the EU customs union as well. Let me take up the point about the Belfast Agreement. That is there for the protection of both communities in Northern Ireland not just one community. It is not just about north/south relations, it is also about east/west relations as well. I think, unfortunately, the United Kingdom under Theresa May fell into the trap that was led for them by the Republic of Ireland that the Belfast Agreement was about no borders on the island of Ireland, but we can have a border internally within the United Kingdom. It is offensive, it was not what was envisaged by the Belfast Agreement. That’s why we have to try to not only minimise it but get rid of it. It is offensive to the United Kingdom constitution and we need to deal with it in the proper way.
