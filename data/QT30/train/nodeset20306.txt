Audience Member[0:20:24] Yes. I mean, after Brexit which divided us, now with this pandemic, do we really want independence to resow division and cripple our economy? It was once in a lifetime we were told, and we voted.

Michael Forsyth[0:20:44] I took the view that if the SNP had been able to get the support of the Scottish electorate then there should be a referendum, and I said that many years ago. And we had a referendum. And it was once in a generation referendum. The things about people who say they believe in democracy, they don't accept the referendum. And the Scottish Parliament, the elections to the Scottish Parliament, the duties of the Scottish Parliament are about health, education, employment, the things that really matter to people. They're not about constitutional matters. They're reserve to the United Kingdom Parliament. The reason the SNP are campaigning on this constitutional issue is because they're not interested in devolution, they're interested in the destruction of the United Kingdom. And they don't want the election to be about their record on health or any other areas because it is abysmal. When I left office, Scottish education was way ahead of England, now it is way behind.
