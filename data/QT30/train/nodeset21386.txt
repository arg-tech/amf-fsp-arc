Nick Thomas-Symonds[00:30:36] But in terms of this particular announcement I do worry about the gap between rhetoric and reality, because we've had in seven years, by the way, 60 different rail projects announced for the North of England by this government and we've yet to see a spade in the ground, so forgive me for being sceptical about this particular announcement. But my concern is this, my constituents and people around the country, what they want to see is an efficient railway available to them with reasonable phase and a timetable that works. Remember it was a disaster with the timetable in 2018 that led to this review being set up in the first place. My worry about the plans as they've been set out is, yes, there is that increased measure of public input. It is this arm's length government body it looks like that is going to have this central coordination. But you've still got concessions being run by private companies, and my real concern is that you end up, as it were, nationalising the risk and privatising the profit instead of making sure that it's value for money on the railways that we should be putting first.
