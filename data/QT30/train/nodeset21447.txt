[LUCY FRAZER] : It is not just scientists that offer different points of view. Of course we need to listen to all the scientists, especially those on SAGE, and we all need to look at the data and take into account some of the things that your Panel have been saying in relation to other matters as well, impact on mental health, impact on the economy. So politicians look at the health data but then they have to look at everything in the round. Can I just answer one point that Anthony made because he compared us to other countries. And I think it is also important to look at what we've done in comparison to other countries on the vaccine. So, we're in a really strong position at the moment. We now know as of today we vaccinated 50 percent of adults. We're continuing to roll out that programme. That is one of the reasons why, if the data -- the other data is good, one of the reasons why we might be able to open up on 21 June.
