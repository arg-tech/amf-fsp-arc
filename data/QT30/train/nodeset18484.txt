Fiona Bruce [00:38:48] But it’s also… It’s not just propaganda, obviously, I think people are confused by the different information that’s coming out, you talked about this report from Stanford 0.1 to 0.2 per cent…
Rocco Forte [00:38:55] Yeah, but I mean the German, the German…
Fiona Bruce [00:39:56] But let me just say, that was not peer reviewed, as I expect you know, and other scientists have come out with different figures in terms of statistics for deaths coming from coronavirus.
Rocco Forte [00:39:07] The German, there’s a report by experts in the German government, which was leaked, which says that the German government’s reaction was completely over the top, was unnecessary, they compared it to the 2017 and ’18 influence epidemic, which killed one and a half million people across the world, it killed 25,000 people in Germany, 28,000 in this country, and the economy of the world was not locked down. In ’68, when I was 23, we had the Hong Kong Flu. That killed over a million people worldwide. We had 80,000 in this country. I don’t remember anything about it, it wasn’t talked about.
