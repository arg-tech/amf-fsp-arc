Willie Rennie[00:32:00] We need to make sure we exploit that potential as well. And if we reduce the demand there won't in time be the need for the oil and gas reserves that we have in the North Sea. But then we'll have created the jobs, the thousands…thousands and thousands of jobs will be created populating all that work to make sure that we can reduce that demand. That's the step by step way. It's the hard graft that needs to be done in order to make sure that we can make this just transition real, because we can't afford to do a repeat of the 1980s where we just left communities in the lurch. The one, in fact, that I leave in was left in the lurch with thousands of people unemployed for years on end, scarred for life – that cannot be done again. So we need to have this transition, and the transition is done by reducing demand, by using the new technologies to make full use of tremendous resources and the skills and the talents of people here. We should be able to create a massive number of jobs if we do this right. A cavalier approach will not [voices overlap 33:17].Fiona Bruce[00:33:18] Okay, quickly.
