[0:10:00] You're massively misrepresenting the situation. Combat operations finished in 2014. You're living in the past. There have been very few US or UK casualties. This is one of the problems with the line that Biden is selling. Since 2014.

[0:10:18] Why do you think it is, Rory?

Rory Stewart
[0:10:20] Because we were conducting since 2014 air operations from bases in support of the Afghan national army. There was no significant pressure against our forces on the ground, they were never tested. This idea that Biden is selling, and that you're trying to sell, that we were still stuck in the middle of a bloody civil war, and we had no alternative other than to leave, is totally false to the millions of Afghans, the millions of Afghans whose lives have been improving over the last few years. You're much too pessimistic about what has been happening in Kabul. I don't know when you were last in Kabul. When were you last in Kabul? When I was in there in November I can assure you that people that I've been working with for 20 years are in a much better situation than they were before.
