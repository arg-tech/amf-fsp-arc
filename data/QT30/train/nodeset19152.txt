Fiona Bruce[0:14:50]Yes, Chris, we’re still waiting for a report from the Conservative party into prejudice. It was announced last year. When are we going to see that?Chris Philp MP[0:14:57]Well, that report is underway. It’s independent. It’s being conducted by a former commissioner from the ECHR…Fiona Bruce[0:15:01]But Paula’s asking when will we see it?Chris Philp MP[0:15:04]Well, the work is underway. I can’t give you a date tonight, but the work is underway.Fiona Bruce[0:15:09]Because it’s been almost a year now.Chris Philp MP[0:15:09]But I would point out there is only one political party in history that’s been investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, that is the Labour party on this antisemitism issue. I would also point to the fact that the Conservatives have appointed the most diverse government in British history. We’re the first party to have appointed an ethnic minority Chancellor of the Exchequer, and a second ethnic minority Chancellor of the Exchequer. We were the first party to appoint an ethnic minority Home Secretary and a second ethnic minority Home Secretary…Bonnie Greer[0:15:35]Chris, Chris, Chris…Chris Philp MP[0:15:36]…so we have appointed the most diverse cabinet as a symbol of our commitment to this important issue.
