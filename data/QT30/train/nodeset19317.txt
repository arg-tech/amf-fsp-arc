Tom Kerridge [00:10:02] From my point of view it has been a magical couple of days, the news that’s coming through. It feels like there’s an end to this nightmare we have all been living. There’s short-term excitement about it, long term there are the problems of getting everybody vaccinated to make sure we can get our lives back to normal and running in that space. Yes, we have a poor track record how we’ve dealt with coronavirus. I have to be honest. You look at the way that the whole thing has been dealt with, you look at the track and trace system, it is something that we have struggled with. There have been bold claims about it and we’re still struggling with this now. So I can understand people’s worry, Colleen’s point of view are we going to fall into the same trap where it comes to rolling out the logistics of this. However, logistics isn’t falling into the tech problem where we’re trying to get everybody to download apps; it is more about getting close to people and resolving it. So, yes, I think if there are the army brought in, if there is people who are all over this have an understanding of how logistics work, it isn’t the same as the track and trace system, so it gives hope that perhaps there is something coming through the other side, that we will, eventually, get something right during this.[DONE]
