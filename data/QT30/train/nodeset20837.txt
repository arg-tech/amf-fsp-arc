I mean, I think it's been a brilliant success, hasn't it? And consequently, we should be safe, we should be protected, we should be in a position where if we go on holiday, we're not going to reimport coronavirus, that's not the way it works. We have got a situation where fantastically we are now largely as a society not at the same risks because of the vaccine situation and consequently, I think to accept the draconian measure of a government, for example, banning you from leaving your own country is something that we should be very sceptical about.
