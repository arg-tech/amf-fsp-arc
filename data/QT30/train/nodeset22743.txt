Fiona Bruce[0:36:13]You're talking about the deal that Trump has proposed for Israel.
Bonnie Greer[0:36:15]Yes. I mean, how is that a peace deal? And that's the con that Donald Trump lays down. The first racist demonstration after Donald Trump became President was in Charlottesville. Anthony Scaramucci Jewish girl was killed. This was guys walking down the street looking like something out of the Nuremberg Rallies saying Jews will not replace us. Now, I don't get it, okay, I really don't get it how anybody can talk about backing this man with that kind of thing. It's a con. It's a total con. And to leave the Palestinians out of this is another part of the con.
Marie van der Zyl[0:37:01]All I've said in fairness to him is that in terms of foreign policy the Abraham Accords and the normalisation of relationships is important for the region.
Bonnie Greer[0:37:10]But don't you see the 300...? That's what I was talking about when I was talking about trauma. I'm talking about the 360 degrees of this. How can you look at that and then look at...? Joe Biden came into the presidency because of Charlottesville. That literally was white guys walking down... You saw it.
Marie van der Zyl[0:37:28]Listen, I agree that...
Bonnie Greer[0:37:31]Explain it to me.
Marie van der Zyl[0:37:31]...Trump is very divisive...
