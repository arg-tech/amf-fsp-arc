Part 19Bernadine Evaristo [00:24:02] I think that, you know, I’ve found Boris offensive all along, with his journalism in The Spectator, with the racist things that he said. When he became Mayor of London, yes, he became mayor of an incredibly multicultural city, but one of the first things that he tried to do, was to get rid of Black History Month, right? So, we’re talking here about the importance of history and acknowledging the past, and also we should be celebrating the entire population, people of colour and our contribution to this society, we’ve been here since the Romans, it’s something I’ve written about, and we have a mayor who tries to get rid of the single thing that we do, to bring to the wider public, the fact that we have a history. And in fact, the truth is, of course, black history is British history. This is a multicultural country and always has been. And British history is world history, because we had an Empire, that ruled over a quarter of the world, for a very long time. So, I really don’t accept you apologising or trying to present Boris Johnson in a good light, because I’ve found him deeply offensive.
