Fiona Bruce[0:01:10] James, the question is why have we failed on the exit strategy?James Cleverly[0:01:14] To implement democracy, and that has proven to be a much, much harder proposition. The British position had always been that we wanted to have an exit based on certain criteria, certain conditions that had been met.Fiona Bruce[0:01:28] Do you think that has happened?James Cleverly[0:01:28] The American administration obviously felt they wanted to leave within a particular time frame, and we've now seen that there has been, both from the Trump administration and the Biden administration, a delivery on that American domestic, American decision, and we are now seeing the ripple effects from that. There is still work to do. We need to make sure that we embed the successes that we have had, and there have been some successes, and we also need to make sure that Afghanistan doesn't once again become the place where terrorist attacks happen.
