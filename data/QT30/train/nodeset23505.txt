Tim Stanley[0:36:08] The reality, I expect, is it a reduction in individual consumption and spending a lot more money through taxes, subsidies, increased prices, etcetera, etcetera. So I'm waiting for the moment when western governments are a little bit more honest with their public and say to them: If you really want to do this, we can do it, we're making progress, but it is going to cost the consumer a lot of money and it is going to require a change in lifestyle. When you put that proposition to the public, you might see some consumer resistance.
Fiona Bruce[0:36:42] The man there.
AudienceMember 20211111QT11[0:36:44] Good evening. The cost to the consumer, the general public, but what about the actual politicians that are attending this conference? They're flying from all over the world. The American President landed on Air Force One. He had many limousines to take him to the actual conference. How is that helping climate change?
AudienceMember 20211111QT12[0:37:12] It doesn't and it's disgusting and the conference should have been as virtual as possible. This is my point. Politicians are going to ask us to make significant sacrifices in the next few years. If they are still flying to a climate conference -- by the way, in the middle of a pandemic -- that looks absolutely appalling. I guess that fish gotta swim and the rich got to fly, but if they are trying to persuade us, ordinary people, to adjust our lifestyles to meet their ambitions, it is about time they started to do it as well.
