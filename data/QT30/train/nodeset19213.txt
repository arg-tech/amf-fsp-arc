FIONA BRUCE [00:14:24] You don’t know if it is 50 or 70 percent of the population. MATT HANCOCK [00:14:28] That’s right. Because the evidence from the trial is how much it protects an individual. You can find out once a lot of people have taken it what the direct impact is on stopping the spread of the disease. FIONA BRUCE [00:14:40] This particular vaccine, Robin, we don’t know if it stops people catching coronavirus but we do know it stops 90 percent of them getting sick from it. ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:14:52] It’s really early. We know it prevents people developing disease for a period of time that it has been studied. We don’t know whether it will protect people for 6 months for 12 months. We have no information right now as to whether it will prevent transmission. So that means its first priority is actually to use it to protect be vulnerable populations.
