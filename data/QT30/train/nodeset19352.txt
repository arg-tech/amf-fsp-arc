Fiona Bruce [00:52:16] We don’t have much time left but one more question from F.. [Georgia]: Due to the Covid crisis teaching across universities has been dire. Some students are only receiving 2-hours a week, creating 289 per in-person session this semester. How can you justify charging this amount, especially to those in lower socio-economic brackets. 
Fiona Bruce [00:52:44] I’m assuming you’re a university student, Georgia. What has your experience been? [Georgia]: It has been difficult in terms of Covid. Last year we were dismissed from university early, earlier than expected. It has become very prevalent that corona is not going anywhere. But the management within many universities has been rather abysmal, in my opinion, we haven’t received the education we’ve been promised. We haven’t received the resources we’ve been promised. Everything has been put on hold. As a student I’m still paying obscene fees for minimal education.
