AudienceMember 20210318QT10[0:13:42] There have been 6 women and two little girls killed in our country since that happened. We have to give women more confidence when abuse is starting to happen in the home to come forward and know they will get support. On average it is more than the 40th incident of abuse before a woman will come forward. If those women, bravely coming forward, telling what has happened to them, only see a 4 or 5 percent prosecution rate, that is telling women it is not worth coming forward. .Mims Davies[0:14:20] It is right that we mention, you can tell that to your pharmacist and they know you need help. You can declare if you come to a DWP job centre, we can help you. It is important, if you are reflecting on what we heard in Parliament today, those are very worrying statistics.Steve Reed[0:14:42] 4,800 women came to seek support from a refuge were turned away because of cuts in funding to women's refuges. That's unacceptable.Fiona Bruce[0:14:54] Alex.AudienceMember 20210318QT11[0:14:56] I just wanted to pick up on when he said men need to reflect on what they do to help women be safe in public. We need to reflect, we need to be asking our mums, sisters, partners, what is it that men can do and, specifically, what can I do to make women feel safer and be safer out in the streets.
