Minette Batters[0:23:58] Now we know that already some of these pigs are sadly having to be culled. It has to be resolved because this is livelihoods and this is people's businesses and unless we are saying to these farmers "We don't want a pig industry in this country", do you know what will happen then? We will import pigmeat that's produced to lower standards. What will that say to the consumer who wants high quality, high welfare British pork? This has been a human disaster for the pig farmers who are distraught. I must make a comment that George Eustice is doing everything he can as the Secretary of State in DEFRA and I believe Steve Barkley who is charged with saving Christmas yet again, I think it is the fourth Christmas we've saved, is doing everything he can, but we haven't got this over the line. I haven't been able to get to see either Kevin Foster or Priti Patel in the Home Office and it doesn't end there. When we talk about low skilled workers, these were the key workers. We have seen a daffodil harvest that didn't happen. We have seen hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of tomatoes wasted and these sectors are worth a lot to our economy.
