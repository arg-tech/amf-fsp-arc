Fiona Bruce[00:43:12] But where is the problem that you feel you need to go to the expense and the effort of doing this?
Robert Buckland[00:43:17] I think that it's important that we maximise confidence. I've heard over the years a number of people, not just my constituents but other people, talk seriously about their concerns that in so many other walks of life you have to produce some form of identification and yet you can walkâ€¦
Fiona Bruce[00:43:32] So this is just based on anecdote then?
Robert Buckland[00:43:34] No, you can walk into a polling station and there is no requirement whatsoever, and this is a pretty important thing people are doing. Now we're not saying suddenly you have to get a special form of ID or you have to go out and buy something that is going to disadvantage you, 98 per cent of people of this country have some form of identification. In fact, we're going even further to say that if there is an issue or a gap then free identification will be issued to people who request it. So if you produce a blue badge, if you produce a number of identification processes that indeed are used by people who are demographically disadvantaged, to lead into Paul's point, then there is no issue at all. It's good sense and the majority of people in this country are wondering why on earth hasn't it been done before.
