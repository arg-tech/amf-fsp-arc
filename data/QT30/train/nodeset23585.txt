Fiona Bruce[00:46:20] So do you think there should be further protection?Andrew Bowie[00:46:24] The protection should be there if a member of parliament feels that they require it or that their staff should require it. But we've got to be very careful to balance that with keeping the so very important aspect, almost unique in our democracy, which is the openness and accessibility of elected representatives to their constituents. We do absolutely need to do something about the tone of the debate in our politics. We have lost and are losing, and you see it in social media, and I see some of the abuse that some of my colleagues get. We are losing, I think, fast the ability to disagree agreeably. And if anything could change in the light of last week's tragic events, given how he went about his business, a man with very strong-held views, some of which I disagreed with, but he would do it in a courteous, polite and amiable manner, and we need to get back to that in this country. Not just between ourselves as politicians, but out in the country as a whole. And to answer the original question, if an MP, NSP, or anybody in public service, because it's not just elected representatives, feels unsafe, then, yes, of course the protection should be available to them to allow them to carry out their business representing this country in whatever capacity they are doing it.
