Keith Brown [00:04:27] Yeah, if I can. I think this is a really important question and it's important because this is a really really important election, and I've stood in every single Scottish parliament election, this is easily the most important. So, you have two paths. One is if the UK is allowed to go ahead, for example, with the ability to sign trade deals which then start to undermine our NHS. If they default, as Douglas has already done, to tax cuts and austerity as their way to deal with the recovery, that's not going to suit Scotland.
