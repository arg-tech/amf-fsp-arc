Lisa Nandy[0:04:46] years, we've been running down under the Tories our renewable capacity. We slashed solar tariffs. They blocked onshore winds and they got rid of gas storage which left us reliant on the markets. He said he would fix social care, but we got a tax hike on working people to pay not for social care, but the hole they have left in the National Health Service budget and now we have got this Universal Credit cut that's going to plunge a lot of people into poverty. You're new into the post as Education Secretary and I was extremely pleased to see you in that job, not least because you could not be worse than your predecessor.
