ROBIN SHATTOCK I think the point is in terms of either being overlooked or deliberately ignored is something that society needs to continue to be challenged on. Disability comes in many shapes. Visible disability often leads to abuse but also I’m very conscious one of my daughters has a chromosomal -- she has no physical signs, but it is a hidden problem that people don’t recognise. It is so critical that, like yourself, Rosie, challenge the rest of society repeatedly. The fight needs to go on and we can never be relaxed and not challenge ourselves whether it is disability or any type of prejudice.

MERRYN SOMERSET WEBB[01:03:26] I haven’t much to add to that, except to say from what we hear is obvious that there are not that many families in the UK that aren’t in some way touched by the difficulties of having someone with a disability inside their family. Obviously, there’s a lot more to be done to help everybody with that. But I would also say we mustn’t underestimate how far we have come in the last 25 years. Everybody now understands, which I don’t think they did then, that lack of access to transport, to education, to employment, etcetera, was a travesty and now is considered to be something that everyone should have access to. So there has been huge change over the last 25 years. Obviously, there’s a long way to go but we must remember how far we’ve come as well.
