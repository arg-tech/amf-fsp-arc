Professor Devi Sridhar[00:19:45] Yeah, it is astonishing, because actually by the point we were discussing in early April you saw New Zealand stop all flights from India, including for their own nationals. You saw Hong Kong stopping flights. Countries can't completely seal themselves off, but they delayed the entry. The problem we now have is twofold. First, we're pretty sure it's pretty transmissible, at least as much as B117, if not more, and that means the race just became even faster to get those younger people, the 30s and 40 year olds, the 20 year olds, people like me as well who are just unvaccinated and completely susceptible. So things might open, my risk does not necessarily change because I have no additional protection. The second thing is does it evade our vaccines? And yes, the vaccines look remarkable, they are holding up. Get vaccinated, you're in a much better position. But there's some uncertainty, and we always know with uncertainty we have to be cautious because we just don't know, and once we know, we can act. But I think right now our Achilles heel in Britain has been the borders and making sure that we don't have these repeated lockdown cycles. Because I think right now domestic recovery should be the focus. Domestic tourism, getting local businesses going. Ask people to fill up our hotels here, fill up tours here, go to your local shops. Edinburgh's suffering. We don't have the festival on as normal. We have lots of people here. So I say go to restaurants, go to shops, enjoy your life, but do it here on this island. We've, what, 66 million people in Britain. That's enough people for me to be with for the next few months while we get through this problem.
