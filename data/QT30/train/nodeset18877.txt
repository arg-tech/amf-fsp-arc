Fiona Bruce[00:33:41] So how ready is that, then?
James Cleverly[00:33:43] And it was tested on the Isle of Wight and a decision was made to go with the other option. That’s the right thing to do, and it’s about learning as we go through this and making the decision. I don’t know exactly when the app will go live.
Fiona Bruce[00:33:59] Because we heard it might not be till winter now.
James Cleverly[00:34:01] But…so as I say, I don’t want to guess and speculate, I don’t know exactly when the app will go live. But obviously, we will continue working with international friends and partners, we will learn from what other countries are doing. And we are…the whole world is learning as we go, and to make sure that we bring about a test and trace app that can be used to protect us all.
Fiona Bruce[00:34:25] Gareth?
Gareth Jones[00:34:28] Yeah, do you not think that the public are going to see this as another U‑turn again, and it’s going to be even harder to get the public on board to actually use the app when it does become live?
Fiona Bruce[00:34:39] Well, do you worry about that loss of public confidence?
