Grant Shapps[0:25:37] Look, if I thought it would, I would do it. We already have six million Europeans with settled and pre-settled status, but if you go to Europe, Poland, 123 thousand shortage, Germany, 60 thousand shortage, the bottleneck is actually people getting tested, and also bringing people back into the market, and for some of the reasons that have been mentioned, Richard and other people have mentioned it, this is a market in which 99 per cent of lorry drivers are white male, average age 55 to 57, and it's because the conditions haven't been pleasant, but it's also because the pay hasn't been commensurate with the job being convenient, the long hours or the nights sleeping in the cab and things like that, and the conditions at truck stops. And these are things that we can do something about, and a higher salary is something that we are happy to see. We don't think peopleâ€¦we think people should be able to work a hard day's work and get paid a proper wage for it. This is something which will correct the systemic problem which has led to shortages for a long time, because it has been constantly undercut by people coming in who are prepared to do the work.Richard Walker[0:26:38] That will take time. I'm worried about Christmas before then.
