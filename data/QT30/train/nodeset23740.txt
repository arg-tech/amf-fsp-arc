Fiona Bruce[0:40:23] I mean, the point they make is unless they do something very big and noisy that everyone notices, life just carries on.
AudienceMember 20210930QT31[0:40:29] Yeah, but if they went to Moscow, Peking, Bombay and started doing it where it's a real problem, you'd go, well done, we'll have some of that as well, but they don't, it's too easy here because we make it too easy, but we agree with what they're saying, but come on, get a grip of yourselves.
Fiona Bruce[0:40:47] Kate.
Kate Andrews[0:40:48] I'm always sceptical to give the police more powers and we don't need to in the circumstances, it's already an offence to obstruct a highway, so I don't think that's a necessary thing to do. I think the police have a tough job at the moment in figuring out how to facilitate this, but the reality is, if you form a protective circle around people sitting in the middle of the motorway, they're going to keep sitting there, and there's a reason we don't go sit in the middle of motorways, I mean, not that that's how many of us would want to spend our time anyway, but I think there does need to be a really hard line on this.
