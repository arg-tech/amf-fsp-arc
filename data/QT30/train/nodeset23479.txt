[0:29:46] Forgive me for interrupting. I'm going to move on because there's a massive topic I want to cover this evening. Before I get to it, I want to say next week we will be in Hartlepool as COP-26 comes to a close. We will have Naomi Klein, then the following week we are in Beckenham where we will be joined by Jordan Peterson. If you would like to be in either of those audiences, do apply on the Question Time website. Do come along, we'd love to see you there.
