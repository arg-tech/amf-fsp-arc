Andy Burnham[0:03:02] I get the increasing impression it is impossible to get sacked from this government. You can breach the ministerial code, you can give contracts to your friends. What would it take, actually, to get sacked?Fiona Bruce[0:03:14] One minister has been sacked which is Johnny Mercer. This is the only minister to have been sacked since the 2020 reshuffle. He's the only one.Andy Burnham[0:03:28] That's my point. I don't think the Prime Minister is setting the right standards. It is particularly important at a time like this. To also just dismiss the feelings that were brought in Question Time, that many families have had not being able to see loved ones, I think it showed he is kind of -- he is not thinking this through properly. I would say that they need to really change how there is a sense of standards being applied to this government, and consistency.
