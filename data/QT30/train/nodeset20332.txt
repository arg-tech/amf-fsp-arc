Angela Haggerty[0:33:52] You have to look at the polls, Iain and Michael. If you're a unionist, you should be looking at the polls and see that support for independence is going up. If you want to stop that, you need to come up with a good proposition for the union which isn't just how terrible Scotland would do if it went out there as an independent country. There's no reason why Scotland couldn't thrive and survive as an independent country. You can't keep going back to the same arguments. You have to give people something more.
Michael Forsyth[0:34:22] I can give you 20 billion reasons why we're lucky to be part of the United Kingdom. 20 billion is how much has come north of the border.
Jeane Freeman[0:34:32] This is not free money, Michael. This is money the Scottish taxpayer pays into the economy.
Michael Forsyth[0:34:40] Your own figures show Scotland gets a huge amount from the United Kingdom Treasury. This particular crisis, I didn't say, the Flo scheme, the vaccines where would we have voted --
Jeane Freeman[0:34:56] We would have been where the UK is, borrowing money to get through this.
Michael Forsyth[0:35:00] Can I finish my point? Where would we be if we voted to leave the United Kingdom? How would we have managed? We wouldn't have had the strength of the United Kingdom around us. We wouldn't have had the support that we've had for the furlough scheme. We wouldn't have had the ability to be able to finance it.
