Nelufar Hedayat[0:42:12] The war in Afghanistan was fought to some degree for the children that I met when I was working at Newsround, and I got the opportunity to go back and make a film about the kids of Kabul. And I went to a place called Skater Stan, and I met young girls wearing their traditional Afghan clothes going up and down these huge skatepark that they had built because the war in Afghanistan gave a generation hope. That is what it gave. Bear with me. You can't kill hope. You can kill people. People have died, and they've lost their lives, and you've all been very honourable in the way you've expressed this, and Mehdi in Washington, DC. Those young girls are now young women who have aspirations and hope, and they will fight it. Images came out of Afghanistan yesterday with four women standing with A4 pieces of paper in a protest, these women who will be killed if the Taliban are what they are. Standing up protesting, today, in three different cities, people stood up and held the national flag of Afghanistan to tear down the flag of the Taliban. What does this say? It says the Afghan people are resilient. It is that they're hopeful. That is what you did. And I have a confused understanding of what this war in my birth land has achieved.
