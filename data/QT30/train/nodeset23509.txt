Paul Polman[0:48:26] What we see now for a chance is we have enough responsible actions coming up that are making net zero pledges, are starting to implement it and, in fact, are the ones pushing the government now to the higher ambitions that we absolutely need. Ultimately, the proof of the pudding is in the eating but many people will be watching. This is not something that are empty words anymore. It's too late for that. I have children, I have grandchildren. That's why I'm here.Fiona Bruce[0:48:58] We have another question related to this subject. Let's hear it from Martin.AudienceMember 20211111QT17[0:49:04] How can people afford to be able to change to heat pump systems and electric cars, given the cost of these things?Fiona Bruce[0:49:14] This comes right to the heart of what you were talking about, Tim, and Caroline. Paul Scully, let's start with you. How can people afford to do this?Paul Scully[0:49:24] Let's take the heat pumps, Â£5,000 subsidy grant towards putting them in but you don't have to put them in now. As Emily described it, it is a glide path to 2050. It is when you are replacing your boiler. That's what I meant about driving markets.Fiona Bruce[0:49:44] I'm sorry, just sticking to heat pumps, that was the question. The cost is 7 to 10,000 pounds. The subsidy from the government is 5,000 pounds. Is that enough for you, Martin --Paul Scully[0:50:00] I'm not asking him to put it in tomorrow. Similar power has gone down 89 percent. You start a market, show businesses that government are backing this kind of technology, businesses have the confidence for the next 10, 20, years they can pile in, invest money.
