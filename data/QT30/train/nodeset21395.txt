Fiona Bruce[00:37:01] Okay. Sue, you had your hand up.
Sue Unknown[00:37:04] Yes, thank you. Yeah, I totally agree, I think we do need some investment in the railway. I can't remember the last time I went on a train. I live in rural Wales, it takes me 90 minutes to get to a mainline station, cost me over Â£100 just to get to London, and I can't even go from the south of Wales to the north, I have to go via England. So yeah, we need some investment and efficiency.
Fiona Bruce[00:37:34] Steve.
Steve Unknown[00:37:36] Yeah, it seems that the private companies that run the rails always seem to be asking the government for handouts, and it just makes sense to me to cut out the middle man. If you remove a profit motive from those companies surely there's more money to spread around and actually use it for buying rolling stock and making the experience better.
Fiona Bruce[00:37:56] Some of the money from the private companies is returned to the public purse, it's worth pointing out.
