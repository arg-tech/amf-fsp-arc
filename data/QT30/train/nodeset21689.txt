[0:08:22] If I was in charge I would have sacked Matt Hancock on the spot, too. I think that the position was clearly untenable given his pivotal role. Not just in creating these Draconian and inhumane rules we have had to live by but often going further and taking a harsher line than many of his colleagues. The position was clearly untenable. I think the delay does reflect very poorly on the PM but it brings in real questions, I think, not just about public trust, which has been, you know, seriously damaged by this and many other things, but I think about the level of compliance. I think when you get to this level of disparity and complete double standards and hypocrisy, there are enough things where this government has forfeited the rights for adherence to the rules that still exist. It is not just Matt Hancock, which was outrageous enough, but there are extraordinary inconsistencies about what's allowed. When you see crowds of the size we saw at Wembley, exemptions for the UEFA VIPs, exemptions for business travellers and you see politicians breaking the rules, but it is difficult to organise weddings, visit sick relatives, and difficult for kids in schools because the same testing are in place, people are isolating in large numbers and it is chaotic, expecting this endless one rule for them, another for us. After a while that starts to grate on people. We need a return to some kind of normality and readjust our priorities in all sorts of ways.
