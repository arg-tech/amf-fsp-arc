AudienceMember 20210708QT06[0:11:06] I did, yes. Just to come back on that. This isn't about the whistle-blower. This is about Matt Hancock, this is about relationships, and about Boris Johnson being incapable of holding his party to account. I agree with what Andy Burnham just said. What is it that you have to do to be sacked for action to be taken? I think in terms of David Davis's comments around there's nothing you would have done differently, well, there's clear gas-lighting going on by Boris here. The matter is closed one minute and he took decisive action the next. It can't be both. When you are stood on a pedestal asking the public to do something but you are ill-prepared to do it, you have to go. As you pointed out yourself, it is inevitable that this person needed to go yet Boris Johnson took no action. So I agree with the audience, complete inconsistencies here, real lack of leadership, really poor.

Chika Russell[0:12:08] I completely understand the Prime Minister was trying to buy time. He is the leader of our nation. All of us are business owners, the public, and I agree with all of the Panel at home in that I agree with, answered, and we need accountability, we need consistency, we need clarity. For myself as a business leader, my team look to me for direction.
