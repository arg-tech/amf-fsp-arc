FIONA BRUCE [00:27:36] Eammon, you’re saying that as a pharmacist. It is worth repeating the words of Prof. John Bell. He predicted with some confidence that life could be back to normal by spring with the big carveout, assuming they don’t screw up the distribution. MATT HANCOCK [00:27:56] I totally agree with Eammon. As a pharmacist you’ll have seen this. The question I was asked was can we do it. The answer to that is yes, we can. FIONA BRUCE [00:28:06] The question is the storage and distribution infrastructure in place to guarantee it. MATT HANCOCK [00:28:14] Is this going to be an enormous challenge? Of course. This is going to be one of the biggest civilian operations in history. It will have all the challenges that Eammon set out. But I think that the NHS can rise to them and I think that we can come together and we can help make it happen. So that’s what I’m -- I’m confident that we can make it happen. I’m also highly confident that it will be extremely difficult and one of the biggest logistical exercises this country has ever seen. There have been huge challenges in so many parts in response to this coronavirus. Huge challenges. We learned a huge amount all the way through. It hasn’t been easy, but you know we got through so many of those challenges in the past.
