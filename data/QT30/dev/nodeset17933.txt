Andy Burnham[0:30:50] Well, certainly I have tried to work with the government. I have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. I understand how difficult the challenge is that they are dealing with. I have a lot of sympathy with that, but they seem to me to be repeating the same mistakes throughout this. The first is that sometimes the rhetoric is running ahead of the reality. We saw that on testing. We saw it on PPE. I think we are seeing it again with this. From what I know here in Greater Manchester. There will not I a world beating system in place by 1st June as the Prime Minister seemed to suggest yesterday. Fog fog Chris is saying it will be. What makes you say that, and each.Andy Burnham[0:31:32] They just appointed the Chief Executive of Leeds about ten days, two weeks ago to try to integrate the local knowledge with this new national social distance testimony of the he is working through that at the movement. It is complicated. As I say, from what I know, it will be beginning by then, but it will nowhere near be in place. I just feel that 1st June date is kind of going back to that conversation we were just having about schools. Really schools should only be really reopening when this was fully in place. The second mistake, fee, if I can just touch on this as well, you know, theres lay lot of local expertise on these issues but throughout this the government has almost kind of disregarded that and kind of rushed to stand up its own national systems and sign contracts with five entries and then try to build something from scratch. I think we are seeing that here. There is some doubts about the quality of the training being provided. You know, they really should have used the local expertise first and built from there. I just feel the government is making problems for itself by not sort of learning from some of the earlier mistakes and then going down a different bath. I think we are getting there is the way I would describe it, but I think the government should be honest with people. That would be a better policy. It is going to be middle June before this system is up and running.
