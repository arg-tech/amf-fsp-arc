Fiona Bruce[0:34:23] I mean, it sort of brings us full circle back in the first question with schools actually, because you had a Member of SAGE, the body that advises the government, saying "a well functioning track and trace system needs to be embedded and working well before schools can reopen". Camilla, you are really keen for your kids to go back to school. The system is going to start on June 1st, track and trace. You will see. You are very confident, cais, it is going to be all social distance dems go from the get go. Do you have any concerns about that.
Camilla Tominey[0:34:58] Well, from the perspective of all of the evidence pointing to children not being badly affected if they do catch it and not seemingly being as infectious as adults and considering all of the measures that schools have been put in place to make sure that children are safe and considering the fact that they are missing out on so much of their education by being at home, all of this is about assessing risk and weighing up the different probabilities and I think on a balance of probabilities overall after now two months at home with us trying to home educate them as well as we can while also working I think that on balance my children are better off in school. Yes, I do.
