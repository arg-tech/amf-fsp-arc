Fiona Bruce[1:07:36] You think it might have spread in care homes anyway.Layla McCay[1:07:40] That's the thing. At the end of the day we don't know when this first started circulating. It looks as though when you started testing has a real impact on this, looking at other countries and care homes. It looks like people going in and out of care homes, potentially, of course, playing its role. While we really, really want an answer to that, it is too early to figure out what's going on, but we can see that we need an answer and we need to learn. I guess what I would say is this really exposes the under-investment and the undervaluing of social care for successive governments. What we really need here is a bit of a long-term plan.Layla McCay[1:08:26] We have seen what's going on in social care. It is really great that the Government has now, you know, giving some money towards social care to say "Goodness, we need to bolster, for example, your infection control mechanisms". Our members have been telling us for ages that while hospitals started to get PPE in, care homes have been in a much worse position for that. There is a lot of disparity for that. There is now funding so that care homes are able to get better infection control processes in place and things like that but that's a short-term fix.
