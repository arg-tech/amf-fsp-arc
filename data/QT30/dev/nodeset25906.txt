Fiona Bruce[0:48:58] I am going to move on. I want to get one more question in which quite a few people wanted to speak about. Charlie.AudienceMember 20210819QT19[0:49:06] Just quickly. Do you think that the pitch invasions by the fans at Manchester United will contribute to a change of power towards fans or will they ultimately be ignored?Fiona Bruce[0:49:18] Robert.Robert Jenrick[0:49:20] Well, the government acted very swiftly when the plans came forward by the bosses and the owners --Fiona Bruce[0:49:26] For the European Super League.Robert Jenrick[0:49:28] I think that was absolutely right. It goes against all the spirit of the game. It would have destroyed the game.Fiona Bruce[0:49:34] Should fans have more power?Robert Jenrick[0:49:36] I think fans absolutely should do. We're doing a review led by Tracy Crouch who people will know is one of the most independent-minded members of Parliament. She has been thinking about this for a long time. I've got confidence the government will take forward the proposals. We need now a shift in the fundamental power dynamic in the game away from big billionaires back to the fans. Because football is part of our heritage, our culture, whether that's the biggest or smallest clubs.
