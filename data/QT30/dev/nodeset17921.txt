Fiona Bruce[0:07:00] Do you think we could be doing that kind of thing here.
Helle Thorning-Schmidt[0:07:03] Why not? We have empty museums, empty theatres, empty sports facilities. Why not use those facilities and give of a different kind of education? What I am seeing in Danish schools, yesterday I just saw a report, children were getting sailing education in the sea. So why not actually use this time to think differently about education and team up, but it can only be done by local authorities. It can't be dictated by the government. That's another reason why I think the government needs to have much more consultation with the four nations of this country, with local authorities, with cities to make sure this can happen in a smooth way and I would really advise to take the heat out of this because nothing good comes from this row that we have seen over the last week.
