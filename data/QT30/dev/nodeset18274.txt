Alex Massie[0:09:14] I also do think this scandal, because it has become a scandal, it started as a story, but the Government's reaction to it has turned it into a scandal, has basically wounded a lot of the messaging that is out there at the moment. It is entirely understandable in some ways that people will take the message that if there is one rule for Government advisers and a different rule for the general public, they will take the view they will do their own thing, regardless of what the official advice says.You know, the Government's arrogant dismissal of this, the suggestion it is not a story at all and it is time to move on won't do. I mean, you know, as Esther Webber said in the Times the other day, the problem with the move on idea is that the public is not convinced moving on is an essential journey.Fiona Bruce[0:10:03] Keith, you have your hand up.Keith[0:10:06] Yes. I mean, I am going to disappoint Alex here by saying I think we should do exactly that, move on. For you political commentators and members of the opposition party, you know, Dominic Cummings' story must be like Christmas, your birthday, New Year rolled into one. You must be loving it. I mean, Emily Maitlis had to take the day off because of over excitement. Move on. I can't be bothered. I have a mind of my own. I know what to do and not to do. What Dominic Cummings does or doesn't do has no impact on me at all. You know, I am more interested in whether there is self raising flour or eggs on the market shelf tomorrow than listening to Dominic Cummings stories. Alex, yes, let's move on.
