Fiona Bruce [00:09:21] Rocco?Rocco Forte [00:09:24] Well, there’s a quote of Nelson Mandela that says, ‘Hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment. We have to understand our history and we have to confront it.’ And I agree very much with what Robert Buckland was saying that we can’t judge the past by the values of today. And it seems that people are trying to use the evil of slavery to re-write the history of this country, and try and negate the heritage that this country has. Fiona Bruce [00:10:04] So, do you think it was wrong to take down the statue of Edward Colston?Rocco Forte [00:10:06] Yes, I think it’s wrong to take it down in that way, and I think any vandalism of any kind is completely unacceptable. It’s against the law, and it’s disgraceful that the police were not there in sufficient numbers to prevent that happening. Fiona Bruce [00:10:24] I mean, people have made comparisons…Rocco Forte [00:10:25] The worst aspect for me, of the London demonstration was seeing police running away from demonstrators in fear. That’s a breakdown of law and order, and it’s mob rule. And it’s completely unacceptable.
