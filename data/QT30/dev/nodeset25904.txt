Public health messaging is very
important having worked in healthcare for the last 20 years, it is about reaching
communities who don't understand or have the fears, they're going on to YouTube
and they are seeing the stories and they have a fear of the vaccine, and those
are those communities who are at highest risk, the poorest communities, and
those are the communities that we're not reaching. So we've got to invest more
into public health messaging. We've got to do that.

 
 Lucy Powell[0:26:14] 
It is accessible. There is language
barriers. They can't book themselves in. They're waiting for calls still. I
know loads of older people who are waiting for a call. We need to put more into
the longer tail.

I worked on meningitis uptake and we
were working with CCGs and people were going out, phone calls and door
knocking. You've got to do these other things.

 
Gillian Keegan[0:26:46] Black and Asian communities have
tripled the uptake since April. Those people who said they will get the jab
have gone up 25% in the Muslim communities. The messages are getting through.

 
Kavita Oberoi[0:27:00] 
Because they have seen what happened
in India.

 
Gillian Keegan[0:27:02] 
That's definitely true.

Quickly.

I'm going to say everyone who is there
right now, I had a stroke a year-and-a-half ago because I behaved badly. I
caused it for myself.

 Fiona Bruce[0:27:16] 
Meaning you were living an unhealthy
lifestyle.

 Frank Luntz[0:27:20] 
A very unhealthy lifestyle. I'm so
focused on people getting vaccinated because they know it saves lives. They
know it works. It is 100% undeniable. So if anyone up there who has the chance,
your participants here or anyone watching, has the chance to be vaccinated,
please, don't make the mistake I made.
