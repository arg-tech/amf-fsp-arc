Layla McCay[0:24:51] The app question is interesting, because, of course, we were promised that the app would be here as part of that system. In some ways we don't need to be really distressed that it is not there on day one, because it's only part of the system. It is not the main part of the system. It's an adjunct. It will be something that will improve our ability to find people who are at risk and make sure that they are able to quarantine and be safe, but I think that this is really more of a challenge that we keep on being promised things are going to be here and then they're not. It's part of what I was saying before about just eroding people's confidence.The NHS has had lots of disappointments. They have been promised PPE coming on a plane from Turkey and then it has not come. They have been promised PPE that's going to work and then suddenly it is sub-standard in some way. There is lots of expectations that are raised and then they are dashed. I think what we are hearing from health leaders is promise things that you are able to deliver when you are able to deliver them and that will really help to build staff confidence and help to build patient confidence.
