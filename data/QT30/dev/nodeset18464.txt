Liz Saville-Roberts [00:21:53] Could I ask one specific question there,
please? The black population in Wales is over-represented by five times
within the prison population of Wales, surely that is a desperate
failure? That is an indication of the racism in our society in action. Would
you, as the Secretary of State for Justice, commit to using that as a target to
reduce that percentage, that unacceptable percentage within the prison
population, specifically in Wales, but of course it applies through England and
Wales entirely? 
Robert
Buckland [00:22:22] Well, what I commit to Liz, is making sure that
the problems that are inherited by the criminal justice system, are dealt with
further up the line, and the diversions that are needed in order to help people
of that background, not to get into the system in the first place, are what
we’re going to have to do. And that’s not just me, that’s Education,
that’s Health, that’s Housing, that’s the whole apparatus of government, in
Wales and in Westminster, actually coming together around the problem and the
individual, rather than this silo approach that means that I end up being
responsible for a system with a disproportionate number of young people from
that background within it.
