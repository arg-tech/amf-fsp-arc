[0:03:46] Why not answer the question of who initially paid
for it, he must know.

 
Anne-Marie Trevelyan

[0:03:50] I think he has answered the question.

 
Fiona Bruce

[0:03:54] Why has he not answered the question of who
initially?

 Anne-Marie Trevelyan

[0:03:56] I'm comfortable with the fact he said it has been
paid for out of his pocket that's fine and should there be alternatives that
the Electoral Commission needs to investigate he said he is happy to provide
any documentation that's required. Indeed he has also been very clear that
officials have made sure all the way through that everything was fine and I'm
very comfortable with the Prime Minister's answer.

our audience Hannah?

[0:04:20] It's the -- we are saying he said he has paid for
it, but again like you have said, he hasn't said who initially paid for it. Did
he always intend to pay for it, that's the thing. Was this -- he saw as a way
of cash for access as we have seen with Cameron? And lobbying, we have had that
very recently. There's no, there hasn't been a clear answer. Can you say that
there has because he said he has covered the cost, but when he covered that
cost, and did he actually anticipate covering that cost when the money was
originally spent. I don't think that's been answered at all.
