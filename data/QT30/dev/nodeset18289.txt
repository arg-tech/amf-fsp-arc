Fiona Bruce[0:22:28] We are all getting to grips with how this is going to work. So if we develop symptoms, we contact one of these tracers. I am not sure who we contact actually. We contact somebody.
Helen Whatley[0:22:42] If you develop symptoms, you should go home and isolate. Then you should order a test, which you can do online or by phoning 119.
Fiona Bruce[0:22:51] So you inform 119 if you think you might have symptoms and you ask for a test.
Helen Whatley[0:22:55] Yes.
Fiona Bruce[0:22:56] If you test positive you are asked to supply details of who you have been in contact with.
Helen Whatley[0:23:02] Correct.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:02] What do you do without the app? What do you do about all the people who you have been in contact with when you don't know their name, address or phone number, people you were on public transport with or a shopkeeper?
Helen Whately[0:23:20] It goes hand in hand with social distancing. If you had been keeping 2 metres apart, that wouldn't count as a contact.
Fiona Bruce[0:23:26] With people you have been closer, either in the workplace or perhaps because you have gone on public transport, without the app how are you going to know the people we don't have details of?
