Fiona Bruce[0:14:36] Let me read comments on social media. Lawrence says "if it is safe to go back to school, why isn't it safe for the house of Parliament or are our children test subjects".
Fiona Bruce[0:14:48] No, not at all. From 2nd June, so that's a day later, these arrangements to vote remotely are being ended. We are going back in. It is important that the national Parliament does its job scrutiniseing what the government is doing, properly asking questions. Things like bill and ledge late I have submit ease haven't been sitting of the let's get Parliament working and showing leadership doing what we are asking everybody else to do, which is go to work if you safely can.
Andy Burnham[0:15:17] Can I just come in. I think it was a really poor decision taken by MPs this weekment we are not asking schools to come fully back. We are asking them to come back on an interim basis. For Parliament to vote to come become completely I think sets a poor example to the count reach. Let's remember Westminster was a hot bed for the spread of the virus a few weeks ago.
Andy Burnham[0:15:41] Sometimes in Parliament Sometimes in Parliament it is a case was do as we say, not as we do. I don't think it is acceptable. It doesn't suggest to me that the premiere work place in the country are taking a safety first approach. (over talking).
