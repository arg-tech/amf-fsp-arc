Rina[1:02:51] I think just the other thing to say, Fiona, I have listened tonight. Every time the Conservative speaks all I hear is "Well, you know, we can't compare ourselves to other countries. Let's put the Dominic wrap to bed. Let's not talk about anything that has shown us up to be the unorganised party we are".
Fiona Bruce[1:03:12] Helen, I will give you a chance to respond to that in a minute. Thank you, Rina for that. I am not trying to cut you offJohn, in terms of what Rina and Alex is saying as well, Nicola Sturgeon is saying, with hindsight, which of course is a wonderful thing, I might have done things differently. When it comes to care homes, I am specifically asking you, what would you have done differently?
John Swinney[1:03:35] I think the circumstances that have been narrated by all three of the people who have spoken, I can't really disagree with their analysis. At the time that COVID was coming towards us we realised that we thought the best thing to do was to ensure that older people who were being accommodated in hospitals where there was no clinical need for them to be there would be better protected if they were in care homes, because if there was an influx of COVID cases into hospitals where vulnerable, elderly people were, the danger of cross-infection was very high.
