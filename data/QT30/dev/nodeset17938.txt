James Graham[0:26:14] Of course I agree it is vital it rolls out as effectively and as soon as possible, not only because of our safety but people need that sense of confidence so we can beginning re-opening our economy. Whether that's restaurants, pubs, bars and obviously hospitality, arts and entertainment. I think there will be a huge benefit to a test that can give an answer in 20 minutes for, say, film and television production. That's not the most important thing in the world I know but it's a vital sector and it's got lots of people through the lockdown. People are going to start to see the autumn schedules clearing themselves of British dramas. That will be incredible to have confidence that you can get actors and crews on a set. They need to fight, hug and kiss each other, unless you want terrible dramas. This stuff does matter. It is not the priority, but I think confidence that people can work safely, and that tour I wases and people who are returning to our city and town centres can eat and drink and re-invest in the economies is incredibly vital.

Camilla Tominey[0:27:24] I should have probably pointed out to be fair the lockdown did come in time for the peak. So there is an argument to say if we had locked down earlier whether people would have psychologically been ready for it and obeyed it. If you see the lockdown coming in on March 23rd, it was about ten days later you see that spike.

Fiona Bruce[0:27:43] The peak follows the lockdown. Lockdown doesn't coincide with the peak. The peak follows the lockdown.
