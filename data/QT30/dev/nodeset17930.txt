Fiona Bruce[0:11:31] Hang on a bit. You have the department of education. That's exactly what they can do. You are saying the only way to tell schools was to do it through a press conference?
Chris Hopson[0:11:40] If you make an announcement to tens of thousands of head teachers you have made it publically. The Unions have been closely consulted about the science. They have been on calls where scientific advisers have briefed them on that. I would urge teaching unions and their members to positively and constructively engage with schools to find safe ways of going back.
Chris Hopson[0:12:02] Of as James said a moment As James said a moment ago, that will be different for different schools because their geography and classroom layouts are going to be different. The important thing is no children get left behind. I would like to add to what James said using these cultural empty institutions is definitely worth exploring. As you said, sadly, many of our great institutions likes theatres and museums are not being used. If we can get children into them that would be a great and enriching experience for them for sure.
