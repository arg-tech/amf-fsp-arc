John Swinney[0:15:22] So the worry I have about all of this is that it has that effect that we talked about, Fiona, that Alison talked about in her question, that it essentially undermines public confidence and compliance.Now this has been a really difficult pandemic for any Government to handle. It is a challenge for us in the Scottish Government. We saw polling information this week which demonstrated very, very high levels of public trust and confidence in the actions of the Scottish Government in how we have handled this crisis. Now that does not mean there's not been hardship. It doesn't mean there's not been suffering, but it means that we have communicated clearly. We have had tremendous consent from members of the public to the measures that we have had to regrettably put in place, and I worry that the Dominic Cummings fiasco and the arrogance that has been demonstrated by the Prime Minister and by Dominic Cummings and by all of the members of the cabinet in the way that they have expected --Fiona Bruce[0:16:26] John, sorry to interrupt. It is worth pointing out when there was a similar issue in Scotland with the chief medical officer who visited her second home, Katherine Calderwood, Nicola Sturgeon did let her go but initially tried to hang on to her, as Boris Johnson is hanging on to Dominic Cummings.
