Fiona Bruce[0:35:40] Let's take another question now from Gerald Amin.
Gerald Amin[0:35:45] Theatres were the first to close and will probably be the last to reopen, which is many, many months away, which could also be the closure of many small independent theatres. Do you think the government should help by bailing us out?
Fiona Bruce[0:36:01] James, I am obviously going to start with you as the playwright here on the panel.
James Graham[0:36:06] Sure. I think it is really worth acknowledging upfront against a background of huge strain on the NHS and the work of carers and these big questions we are asking about kids and when should they go back to school, they will of course always remain the primary focus and that's right but it is also right as the country starts to get back on its feet certain industries and certain companies are going to have to -- they can contribute as profitable industries can contribute substantially to the revitalising and the reopening of Britain. It is incumbent upon us to sometimes have these difficult conversations with government where we need to tell them the specific challenges that we are going to have in order to play that active role in reactivating the economy.
