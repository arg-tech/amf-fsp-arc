Chris Philp [0:29:26] One of the reasons quarantine is going to come in now at the end of the pandemic rather than the beginning of it when by air passengers, There is no point in having a quarantine. They helped less than 0.5% of the case load. Now our domestic case load is going down and there is some prospect that air tribal will do up, it becomes relatively more important. To mess plures like quarantine become significant. On the general response rpbs there were so much things people said would go wrong that have been happened willed very well. About eight weeks ago people said we would run out of the ventilators of the inn fact we have 13,000 and never more than half have been in use. People said we would run out of intensive care beds. We have nearly doubled those and no more than half of those have ever been used by virus patients. All of those aspects of the response including the relationship to the timing have all worked in this country very well. I think we can all collectively take some pride in the way as a nation we have come together. It has been difficult for children and families and arts stect or and older people. It has been tough for all of us. We have worked together. We have been disciplined and thankfully now we are moving into a slightly happier phase ahead. I think we can take collective national pride in the way we have worked together on that.
