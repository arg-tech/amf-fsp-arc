Alex Massie[0:58:13] That now, because the sort of tsunami of COVID cases didn't quite materialise, looks to be a terrible mistake and obviously with hindsight it was a mistake, but at the time it was made I think it's reasonable for politicians to say "but this was the choice we had available to us", but you can only do that I think, you can only get the public to trust you if you communicate with candor, if you allow that mistakes will be made in a fiercely complicated, unprecedented set of situations. But you can't just allow that mistakes will be make. You have to admit to them and take ownership of them as well.If you treat people like adults there is a chance they will understand the position you are coming from. You can't deny that any mistakes took place. It seems to me to be infantilising of Government ministers to try to pretend that could be the case.
