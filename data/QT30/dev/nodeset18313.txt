John Swinney[0:54:52] Now, the indications from the Treasury are that, for example, on the furlough scheme, that's going to be constrained in August by the Chancellor. That's a very damaging move, because we know that the implications of COVID are going to be with us for a long time. So we are appealing to the UK Government to recognise the longevity of this problem and put in place the support to enable that to be the case.
Fiona Bruce[0:55:16] Okay. We have Helen Whately here, John. Let's ask her. For someone in Jeanette's position, self-employed, which comes to an end in the next three days, what will the Government do for people like her.
Helen Whatley[0:55:30] With this I agree on John. The importance of having the support for people who, for instance, are required to isolate because of test and trace.
Fiona Bruce[0:55:38] It is up to the UK Government. So what are you going to do.
Helen Whatley[0:55:43] I know that is something the Chancellor will specifically look at on the self employment question. We know for those who are employed, they will be eligible for statutory sick pay.
Fiona Bruce[0:55:54] Sure.
aHelen Whatley[0:55:56] If they are asked to isolate.
