Camilla Tominey[0:03:05] I have three school age children, a year 6 child, a year 2 child and a year 5 child. One of them can go back, the eldest, year 6. I have been asked by her school if I want her to go back and said yes. So we have half term and then one of my three children back and two at home. That means one of us needs to be at home with the children, so work can't go back to normal. If I had been asked if all of the children should go back, I would have said yes.

Fiona Bruce[0:03:37] You don't have some of the fears we have heard from teachers and some of the unions. That's not an issue for you.

Camilla Tominey[0:03:44] No. I have been impressed by schools how they are going to social distance the children. We have had a massive dossier for the eldest, washing hands, having temperature checks at the door and how they are going to be separated in class.

Camilla Tominey[0:03:59] Equally I know there Equally, I know there is some lack of consensus over the evidence we have so far as to how infectious children are. It is plausible they are not as infectious as adults, but it is perhaps not proven. However, there have been a number of studies in Australia, studies in Finland, of a child who interacted after coming back from the French Alps and having Coronavirus with hundreds of other children and didn't pass it on. The chief scientist of the WHO has said schools should go back in the way we have seen schools go back in parts of Europe. I did a story with the BMA in week that cited the spike in Northern France, but actually the foreign Minister pointed out there 1.4 million children had gone back. There had been 70 cases but most of them had been contracted outside of school.
