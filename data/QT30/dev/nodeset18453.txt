Fiona Bruce[00:04:11] And let me just…Tessa, when you said that you want the government to apologise for reparations paid to countries until 2015, for slavery, what are you referring to?

Female Aud 1[00:04:20] So yeah, so the debts that we were paying off, refers to the 20 million pounds that was paid off to slave owners, when slavery became illegal in 1837, and so that debt is something that the British Government was paying off until as late as 2015.

Fiona Bruce[00:04:41] Robert?

Robert Buckland[00:04:42] Well, look I think the history of our islands is always with us

Fiona Bruce [00:04:46] But, were we paying off that debt until 2015?

Robert Buckland [00:04:47] I think actually, the lady is right, because I’ve read reports similarly about that…

Fiona Bruce [00:04:52] That seems extraordinary.

Robert Buckland [00:04:54] But I think she makes a very powerful point about the fact that you cannot escape history, and I think it would be fundamentally dishonest of us to, through removing statues and airbrushing out history, to then pretend that all was well. Do you know, totalitarian regimes do that? And communist regimes and other extreme regimes do that sort of thing, and then pretend that all is well, no we need to be honest, face up to it, and accept the fact that we are as much prisoners of our history, as anything else, but we have a chance through democracy, to break free, and progress.
