Helle Thorning-Schmidt [0:52:36] Oh, I didn't answer that. Fog fog you are not keen on wearing masks we get that. Fog fog would you rather be served by someone wearing a face mask.
James Graham[0:52:47] I just can't wait to be served by someone. A pint would go down baling balingbaling baling baling get baling baling baling. I this it would become the new normal al. I think it is individual choice and I don't know how you would legislate for it fog to go Andy, where do you stand on the discussion about face coverings or face masks.
Andy Burnham[0:53:10] I think we are going to have to work quite hard to build confidence in the public to go back into the industries and support the cultural venues and restaurant and bars as we were discussing a moment ago. If they can help build that confidence, then why not? I mean, sometimes people can see a face mask and think it is someone being distruct if you will around them. As James said, it is the opposite. It is quite a public spirited thing to do. It is reducing the risk of you giving the infection to other people.
