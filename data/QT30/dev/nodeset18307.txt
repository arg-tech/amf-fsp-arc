Fiona Bruce[0:52:23] That's a heck of a garden you are going to have to have to accommodate that, for no more than 15 minutes.
Helen Whatley[0:52:32] We are asking people gradually to take small steps to try to make life
Fiona Bruce[0:52:38] We are all trying to make sense of how it works since we are all going to have to be doing this. Jeanette, you wanted to come in. Let me bring you in.
Jeanette[0:52:46] I work from home and my girls go to people's houses. This track and trace has the ability to close my business down every single week. I don't know what I am going to do. I have already closed. Financially it's been a nightmare and now if any of my staff or families go to any other houses to clean or do anything we are closed. I was wondering who is going to pick up the pieces because small businesses who work from home have already been missed out on everything and now we've got track and trace. That could close me down again every single week or have girls going off sick because they have been to vulnerable houses, vulnerable places and doing their job, and I don't know what to do. How is the Government going to sort this out.
