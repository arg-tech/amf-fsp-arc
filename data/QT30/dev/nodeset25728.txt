Yanis Varoufakis[0:02:20] London and Brussels are behaving like spoilt brats. Boris Johnson has to confess that the price of ending free movement of people is that he terminated the free movement of sausages between Britain and Northern Ireland. He has to acknowledge the impossible triangle as I call it. You cannot simultaneously have a regulatory divergence, no border within Ireland, and no border down the Irish Sea. You can have two of the three. You cannot have all three bodies. At the very same time, the European Union has been misbehaving, on the one hand yes, they have the legal right to inspect every great British banger that travels across the Irish Sea, but to do this, is an abuse of their legal right.
