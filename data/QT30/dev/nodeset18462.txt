 I think it’s important that as a society, we look at the past, but we 
don’t need to glorify or celebrate the events of the past that we as a 
nation took part in. I agree that statues that have links to the past, 
that bear issues relating to slavery, do need to be taken down. I’m not 
asking for them to be hidden, I think they need to be in a museum, 
because museums are great places to educate and help remember the 
past. Maybe even have history about British colonialism or minority 
ethnic communities in the curriculum, I think that would be an important
 step that we could take as a society?Fiona Bruce

 I was just going to say, I agree completely with what Bernadine 
Evaristo said about the fact that in Bristol… I went to university in Bristol, and for years, you know, it has been a topic of discussion, to 
take it down and, you know, the voice of the whole democratic thing, 
they were saying people have been asking to take that down, and people 
have been ignoring it. So, in some ways, somebody’s been saying, well 
not, actually, it needs to stay up there. So, who were they trying to 
protect there? They’re trying to protect the name of, you know, they’re 
trying to show that their statue should stay, and you say that it’s 
disturbing the way it was taken down.
