[0:22:46] Helle, when we look at the example of Denmark, it has obviously blazed a bit of a trial in terms of returning to normal life. You started the lockdown very early. I have think Denmark had no defendants at that point, probably one, whereas the UK started after 350 deaths. Your lockdown lasted a month. You have now eased it.

Helle Thorning-Schmidt
[0:23:07] Yes.

Fiona Bruce
[0:23:07] In terms of test, track and trace how important was that in terms of Denmark being able to cope with the pandemic.

Helle Thorning-Schmidt
[0:23:15] It was very hard. It would be difficult to find someone who found it would be a good idea to wait a good week in the for the loved. The lockdown simply came too late in this country and I think that caused a lot of damage.

Fiona Bruce
[0:23:28] It was 335 in the UK and zero or one death, something like that.

Helle Thorning-Schmidt
[0:23:35] They realised it was a big deal and locked down a week before the UK. There is no doubt the UK should have done the same. The other thing, looking at Germany, which is the Stellar example here, they started their testing and their tracing and their quarantine much earlier. So that means that even though they locked down more or less the same time as the UK, they were at a different place in their curve, and that basically meant that they have come out of this much better than the UK. I am not sitting here to criticise government. That's not why I am here, but I think we have to learn from these things and just be completely honest that, of course, UK locked down too late, and if this tracing had been up and running much before, I think the country could have opened much before. So the key -- and also in Denmark we had a much softer lockdown. So we locked down before, softer lockdown. Now we are starting the tracking and tracing and quarantining as well. The next thing we have to find out is how are we going to quarantine these people. How is that going to happen? Again a little idea from our own country. They are offering to use some of the hotels that have no guests to help people isolate. So they can he cost of the government can be Isle of Wight owe lated in hoe tells. There have been plans for this, plag Matt I can plans that can be rolled out and it has to be rammed up pretty fast. I have no doubt if it was ramped up earlier, UK would have been safer.
