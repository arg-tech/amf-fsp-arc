Ruth[0:28:57] This track and trace system tell, what if nobody volunteers themselves? I understand it is a voluntary. What happens if people don't give their name? What happens in that situation? How is that going to be handled?

Fiona Bruce[0:29:12] It is an interesting point. If you put yourself forward, you realise you have symptoms, you realise you are going to be in quarantine for the next few weeks. All the other people you mention you have been in contact with for a sustained period of time or closer than 2 metres you are effectively dobbing them in and they are going to have to self-isolate as well. You have the same issue in Scotland as in England. What if people don't put themselves forward?

John Swinney[0:29:39] I think this is the link to the first question we have just had. The reason we have been successful in reducing the prevalence of Coronavirus is because of massive volumes of public participation and compliance. The same applies to the track, trace, self-isolate and support strategy, test and protect that we are putting out in Scotland. It relies on people coming forward where they have symptoms, indicating they have those symptoms and then for us pursuing the contact. There will be privacy applied, essentially the source of the virus that has been drawn to attention of other individuals, but it fundamentally relies on public participation, public trust and public confidence. That's why I really appreciate the comments that David made about how the First Minister has communicated about the challenges that are inherent in handling a pandemic and we need to have that similar level of communication and consent from members of the public in wrestling with the contact tracing strategy.
