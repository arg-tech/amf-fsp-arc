Fiona Bruce[0:36:50] You have the government here in the form of Chris, the one man government here. Do you want to more Bale outs? The government has provided all sorts of money in terms of Coronavirus interruption loans for business, that kind of thing. Is there a separate Bale out that would request from the government for theatres.
James Graham[0:37:09] The job retention scheme was an absolute life safer for so many people in my industry the majority of whom are freelanceers. It wasn't perfect and didn't capture everybody. I think that's something we need to look at. It is unfortunate, because as joy flee over the next few months according to your plan pubs and restaurant and manufacturers Andy tailers start so slowly reopen, that unfortunately is not going to be the case with the perfect forming arts venues. We have tried our very best but it is now apparent there is no real viable social distancing model to get audiences safely and it has to be safe, back into theatres to watch place and muse comes. Up would have to be 20% full if you did the measures and they need to be 80% full in order to sustain themselves economic cleech. That's just a problem, because the cultural sectors are so profitable. It is not like this is the 1970s and we are Baleing out industries that are not profitable. I think the figure is about for everyone pound you invest in the arts you get about five pounds back. We can't wait to be back doing that for up of the it is not the eat give lent whereby arts funding costs hospital evidence abouts. We can pay for more hospital beds in our films, television dramas and theatres of the it is very likely, as Gerald was saying, that might not happen up to a year. This time next year might be the first time we get to confidently reopen.
