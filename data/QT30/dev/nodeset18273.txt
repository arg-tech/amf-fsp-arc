Layla McCay[0:05:02] Reasons one of the hospital CEOs said to us recently this this could actually be one of the biggest risks to public health since lockdown began. So I think that all of these are key considerations as we think about what next.Fiona Bruce[0:05:17] Alison, can I come back to you. Has it had any impact on whether you will be more or less confined as we go into test and protect or test and isolate now.Alison [0:05:27] Well, no, from a personal level I would follow the guidelines. I think I've got enough integrity to do that, but I do think that it will have an impact on some people who are just fed up with the whole idea that someone can get away with something when the rest are not supposed to.Fiona Bruce[0:05:48] Anyone on the Panel think it wouldn't make that much of a difference, people would still do what they need to do in the current circumstances? This is a deeply unscientific poll. None of you are putting up your hands. Eileen.Eileen[0:06:05] Hi, Fiona. I believe it undermines the message, like Alison said, but had it been an MP, they wouldn't have got away with it. If it was anyone else, they wouldn't have got away from it. The fact this person is so close and influential to Boris Johnson is what rocks my confidence.
