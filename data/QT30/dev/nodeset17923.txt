Fiona Bruce[0:07:55] James, your mother works in a school.James Graham[0:07:59] She is an office manager in a primary school up in North Nottinghamshire. She has been doing a lot of these things, making preparations. They are nervous but trying to adapt and be inventive. She has been ordering in pedal bins for when kids sneeze. They have been measuring out how the desks might work in different classroom. I think it is important to say that every local authority and every local school in every local authority is completely different. There are big and small classes. There are areas of great resource and areas of great deprivation. I think it is incumbent on our politicians to empower headmasters and teachers because they know what's best for children in their schools. I don't necessarily see a need for a uniform, standardised national rollout. I think the dates, times and methods need to be decided by the teachers.James Graham[0:08:48] I really love what you I really love what you said, Helle, about the using of cultural institutions to contribute to the positive learning of children. I think, Chair, you mentioned it in your question. We have a whole generation here who are sat at home with these incredibly eager minds and desires to be learning. I think that's definitely one thing that the theatre industry in its lockdown has been reasonably good at. Education departments have been continuing to function and work with teachers to get actors sat at home and musicians sat at home to inspire kids in that way. You know, unfortunately we are not going You know, unfortunately we are not going to be able to open any time soon. I think it is incumbent upon us to find as inventive and as exciting a way to keep our kids stimulated as possible.Fiona Bruce[0:09:32] It has turned into a bit of a mess, this 1st June announcement. You had Andy saying "no consultation", and Helle was talking about trying to take the heat out of this. You have a situation now where on 1st June, at the moment anyway, it looks like there will be 1000, possibly 2000 schools that are not going to open. So this rollout that the government wanted is not going to be happening.Chris Philp[0:09:52] I think there was plenty of advance notice. The measure was announced a few weeks ago, in response to scientific advice. As Camilla said, there is a lot more advice and scientific evidence going to be published tomorrow for all of us to have a look at.
