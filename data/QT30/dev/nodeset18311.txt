Fiona Bruce[0:56:56] Let's hear now from Rina Cuthbertson. Rina. 
Rina[0:57:00] Good evening Fiona and Panel.
Rina[0:57:03] Was a policy decision regarding the emptying of hospital beds with the patients not being tested and the outrageous consequences on our elderly citizens a planned arrangement and, if so, does this not highlight the lack of value and respect we place on the elderly?
Fiona Bruce[0:57:21] So was it a planned arrangement allowing people back into care homes without being tested and does it highlight the lack of value and respect.
Alex Massie[0:57:33] The care homes situation I think is one of those areas where governments in all parts of the United Kingdom face a terrible set of choices, you know. In hindsight, as Nicola Sturgeon said this week, they would probably make some decisions differently. You know, at the time when people were released from hospital into care homes, it was because they feared that the NHS and hospitals were going to be overwhelmed with COVID cases. So, you know, what do we do with people who are delayed discharge, bed blocking or whatever. Well, get them out, almost regardless of their circumstance.
