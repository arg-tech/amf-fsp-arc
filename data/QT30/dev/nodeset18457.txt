Fiona Bruce [00:05:30] Bernadine? Bernadine Evaristo [00:05:32] Yes. I totally disagree with you actually. Because I absolutely relish that statue being toppled in Bristol. They had tried for decades to either get the statue removed, or to get a plaque put on the statue, to provide the context for Colston’s history as a slave trader. And I think everybody now knows that he was culpable in terms of some 80,000 Africans being enslaves in the New World, and 20,000 of those Africans were also lost at sea.So, I think he was a really toxic symbol in Bristol, and it was really important that he should go, or at least be contextualised. And people tried to do that, and they tried for decades. They didn’t get anywhere with it. So, it felt to me that it was totally right that they should topple that statue, because of what he represented, and I am totally for a lot of the other statues in this country, being removed, and perhaps recontextualised in museums, or somewhere where we actually understand what role they played in society in a wider sense, and the whole idea about…Fiona Bruce [00:06:44] And which kind of statues for example, Bernadine?Bernadine Evaristo [00:06:46] So, there was somebody removed from outside The Museum of London, for example. Fiona Bruce [00:06:49] Yes, Robert Milligan who’s a slave trader.
