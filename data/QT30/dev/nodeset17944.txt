[0:12:32] We have Camilla who wants to send her children to school. You have a number of schools who are embracing, happily or not, but planning to go ahead with the 1st June opening. Lots of schools are not. What are parents supposed to make of that. Are some less risk averse. Have some made better preparation? How can parents make any decent assessment?

[0:13:02] I think they are probably a bit confused by it all. It is a row that has been going on. I am not sure that helps parents. I would agree with Helle. Let head teachers sit in the driving seat and decide when it is safe to open school. Parents will probably look most to head teachers for advice about safety of their kids. I think it should also be done in consultation with local councils, I think it should also be done in consultation with local councilsbecause the fact is the circumstances will differ from one place to another in terms of the teaching staff. Some of them may be self-isolating. There may be issues they have to deal with when we look at the staff. There will be physical circumstances at the school.

[0:13:40] Don't forget, of course, the R rate, the R number, the re production number varies from one region to another. Near in the north of England we see a higher R number than in the south. So you can't blame any council for taking a cautious approach. That's why I say to government work in partnership with local councils. Absolutely say to them "let's get schools open on 1st June if we can but we respect the fact if a little longer is needed to get the arrangements in place, then so be it and we will work with you in partnership on that let's get away from teacher bashing. We have seen too much of that over the last few weeks. They have been working really hard through this period often teaching kids at home and being innovative in all the ways we would want them to be. I think we need to sort of de he is collate this row and focus on practical steps so get kids back in school when it is safe to do so.
