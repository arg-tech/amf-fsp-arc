Fiona Bruce[0:06:27] What I am asking is whether or not you feel it would make any difference in terms of compliance generally.
Eileen[0:06:32] Yes, it will. Like Alison said, there is people with integrity out there and people who do the right thing for society and their family. There is other people like Dominic Cummings looks for the loophole and looks for the cheap way. You are cheating society by doing this. Ultimately you are putting lives at risk. Behaviour breeds behaviour, especially with someone so influential.
Fiona Bruce[0:06:59] Matthew, let's hear from you.
Matthew[0:07:03] Just on that point, with all due respect to what you have said there, if I am not mistaken, Stephen Kinnock took it on himself to go to his father's place to sing happy birthday quite blatantly in front of the cameras.
Fiona Bruce[0:07:20] In fairness he said he was dropping off essential shopping for them that they couldn't get. That's what he said at the time.
Matthew[0:07:27] Yes, but it wasn't done in an overly discrete fashion, what happened there. I don't have any political allegiance one way or the other but I think the public, from what I can sense, people I know, are probably just a little bit fed up with the politicising of things as well. All we are after is if we are all in it together, as the slogan says, that indeed those people in public life, like it or loathe it, you have to adhere to that probably to a greater, extent than the general populous, because it comes with the territory unfortunately.
