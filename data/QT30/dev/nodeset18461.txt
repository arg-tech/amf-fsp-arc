Fiona Bruce [00:23:01] Bernadine are you…?

Vaughan Gething [00:23:02] I just think that mealy mouthed refusal to engage in the reality, the Prime Minister has said something deeply offensive at the start of the 21st century, it is a real issue. For people that look like me, having a Prime Minister who used the language of watermelon smiles and piccaninnies, it matters, just as someone comparing the experience of Wales to colonialism and the African American experience, it matters and it’s offensive. And if we want to move on, we’ve got to accept that isn’t acceptable, and you gain credit for yourselves and your parties, and actually the healing that I want to see taking place right across the United Kingdom knowledge that is staring you in the face. ’Cause it isn’t just the fact that I’m a politician, I’m this colour every day of the week, every single day of the year, and it matters to me that we are spoken about and treated in a way that reflects who we are, and not the colour of our skin. So use language that matters and make sure you’re not making these mealy mouthed apologies for things that are plainly wrong
