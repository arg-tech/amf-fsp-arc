I very much hope so, so long as the conditions are suitable and allow for that, because actually it will boom business to come to the best part of the United Kingdom, and that's what we need to be doing is promoting this as a golden opportunity for the staycation market here in Wales, but going back to the point that Daniel was making about travelling, I do hope that we get to a situation where we can travel at some point in this year.

We've got a few more hands up here. Andy?

I personally think there's an opportunity to sort of suspend holidaying abroad and boost the British economy and the Welsh economy by holidaying locally, as Andrew just said, and I think that's hugely important, not to risk transmission coming in from abroad but I do think there's a situation where maybe people need to travel abroad to visit family members that they haven't seen for maybe 12 or 18 months so I think maybe special exceptions should be given for that kind of situation.
