I was privileged to be able to write and share Quiz, which was this major scandal about the coughing. I was delighted to hear from families and audiences watching helping to get it through. I come from theatre. Feeb owe water bridge who sold flee bag to the world comes from theatre. You will start to notice a difference if we can't be saved.

Southall theatre management has gone into liquidation. Enough field theatre has gone into liquidation. Should there be a lifeline thrown to the arts.

Baling baling baling want to give theatre and creative arts industry a future you have to put a date on it so the public can say "brilliant. From September I can look forward to going back to the theatre".
