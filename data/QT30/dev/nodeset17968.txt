Helle Thorning-Schmidt [0:51:51] Mistakes have been made. I will take responsibility as Prime Minister we did not prepare properly for a pandemic like this. We had SARS, the swine flu, all these things but we still didn't prepare properly and I don't think the British government did either, as any government we know apart from the Asian. So we have to be in a mode now where we breathe and say now is a new normal. We all have to be part of doing that and talking about how we want to do and get out of this automatic reaction where we say "we didn't do anything wrong. Surely you can't find a fault with anything". After all this we also have to evaluate and create new standards together fog fog James, coming back to the question, would you rather be served by someone.
