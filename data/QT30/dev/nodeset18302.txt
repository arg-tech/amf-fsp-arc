Fiona Bruce[0:53:42] You run a cleaning company. You have various people going out to clean people's houses. John Swinney, what is the compensation package going to be? Either Jeanette, or somebody who works for Jeanette, and lots of small companies are going to be in similar positions. They get symptoms or have been close to someone who has symptoms. They are told they have to self-isolate for 14 days. What compensation will there be for them.John Swinney[0:54:08] I think the point Jeanette makes illustrates the fact there has to be ongoing support in place for individuals and businesses to make sure people can navigate their way through what's going to be a difficult period if they have to participate in contact tracing.Fiona Bruce[0:54:23] What will be, specifically, the provision for the self-employed come to an end in three days. People working for Jeanette are self-employed. What provision will be put in place for them.John Swinney[0:54:34] That is what I was coming on to. There has to be a need for an ongoing scheme of support to assist individuals in that respect, which is why we continue to press the UK Treasury to recognise this is not a short-term issue. This is a long-term issue that we have to sustain.
