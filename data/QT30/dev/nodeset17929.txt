Fiona Bruce[0:04:44] But the BMA were initially supporting unions in saying that children shouldn't go back.Camilla Tominey[0:04:51] The Telegraph ran a piece with them yesterday where they softened that stance, and said schools should go back on 1 June, if it is safe to do so. From some of the evidence I have seen I feel happy with the eldest going back. If the other two were invited to go back I would say yes. I have sympathy with teachers, but we have to consider the infection rate before the lockdown came in would have been higher than it is now and, arguably, teachers could be more at risk going to the supermarket than into classrooms.Camilla Tominey[0:05:19] I think measures I think measures should be taken, but I am satisfied we have got to the point and I believe that SAGE that informed government that it was the right time to say a phased return to school from June 1st, I understand they are going to be releasing more of their evidence tomorrow. We need to see that evidence. So far it's not been transparent enough, which has led to this confusionFiona Bruce[0:05:38] let's talk Let's talk about the experience in Denmark. Denmark was the first country in Europe to reopen its schools.Helle Thorning-Schmidt[0:05:45] Yes.Fiona Bruce[0:05:45] So why was a decision taken then and how has it worked.Helle Thorning-Schmidt[0:05:50] Well, I think it is very hard to compare the UK with Denmark. Denmark is a much smaller country. We have a different political system, which I hope I can talk a little bit more about, based on much more compromise, consultation. Of course we could never send children back to school without deep consultation with teachers' unions, head teachers and also parents of course, but they did succeed in sending people back.Helle Thorning-Schmidt[0:06:17] One thing I was One thing I was really impressed with, and as Prime Minister I had my fair share of shall we call it debates with the teachers' union, but one things I was really impressed by was how innovative they suddenly all became. They invented new ways of going to school. They had outdoor schools. Copenhagen teamed up with cultural facilities all over town. So suddenly you saw kids having education in our national stadium. They start out singing the national anthem. After that they had their class in the VIP lounge. You saw five year olds having their classroom in the National Museum of Art.
