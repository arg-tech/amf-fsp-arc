Fiona Bruce[0:03:18] Given how critical you are of Dominic Cummings, why don't Labour ask for him to go.

Ian Murray[0:03:25] Kier Starmer said clearly if he was Prime Minister, he have would have sacked him. When the Conservatives are tearing themselves apart over this kind of issue, there is now over 60 MPs that have publicly said he should go. There are over 70 that have e-mailed back their constituents. We have all had thousands of emails on this. The public are incredibly angry. Douglas Ross said in his letter, and Douglas Ross said in his letter when he resigned this week and I think this is crucial, that many of the public have made huge sacrifices including not being able to hold the hand of loved ones when they are dying. How could he possibly say to his constituents they were wrong and Dominic Cummings was right? I think that sums this issue up in a sentence.

Fiona Bruce[0:04:05] Layla, can I ask you as the scientific voice on our Panel this evening do you feel compliance may have been undermined by the events of the last few days.

Layla McCay[0:04:15] Well, it is interesting, isn't it, because it is not exactly about what Dominic Cummings did or didn't do. The question is really about what is the impact of that and what we have heard from our members who are CEOs of hospitals, GPs, all across the health system. People are worried that public health messages are being undermined. They are already hearing that people are making decisions they might not have otherwise made. That's really worrying, because in order for these public measures, whether lockdown, test, track and trace, any of these things to work, we need to have a really clear message that's not open to too much interpretation and discretion and we need to have this public feeling that we are all in it together.
