Fiona Bruce[0:55:44] Kate we have a minute left -- a quick answer.Kate Andrews[0:55:50] This is the nanny state gone mad. I agree with teaching people how to cook. But there's no way this is going to stop people from eating how to eat. The whole scotch egg last year was an example of what not to do. The fact this rule means they have to have exemptions for avocado and olive oil shows it's a poor decision. The Government should not be picking and choosing individual products when it comes to food, and the nanny state has gone way too far, we have had too many restrictions on hour lives, time to step back.Fiona Bruce[0:56:30] So your own impact assessment says the restrictions will lead to children eating the equivalent of a single skittle less every day? With restricting advertising.
