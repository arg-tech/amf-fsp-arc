Fiona Bruce[0:19:23] Let's start with you. Let me ask you about the app. Where are we with this app.
Helen Whatley[0:19:30] The app will be brought forward in due course. The system that we have got in place today is drawing on over 25,000 callers who will be implementing the system.
Fiona Bruce[0:19:41] We were told by Matthew Hancock that the app was incredibly important and we don't have it. Is it just not working. What's happening with it? Just update us.
Helen Whatley[0:19:51] The app will support as we go further down the path, but the important thing is we have got to a point that.Fiona Bruce[0:19:58] We have to find out where we are with the app. If we have problems, just fill us in.
Helen Whately[0:21:52] I am not personally working on the app. The important thing is we have a system in place which we have been able to launch today which means it will support some of the easing of lockdown measures. We have actually to pick up -- we do look at overseas and what other countries are doing. We look to make sure we have drawn on the best of what you see elsewhere and we have also got to a point that we can launch the NHS test and trace system, because we now have the number of cases and the infection rate under control. So we are actually in a position that it will really work to do the contact tracing and the isolating.
