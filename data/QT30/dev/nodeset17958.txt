[0:19:23] Well, Claire, thank you very much for your question. Thank you for joining us live. Let's go to Alfie now, who has another question for you have.

Alfie
[0:19:32] Hi. Test, track and trace sounds really, really important but what will be in place on 1st June will be missing many components including the contact tracing ap. So when can we expect to see the full implementation of test track and trace.

Fiona Bruce
[0:19:50] Full implemenation, according to the government anyway, is critical in terms of easing the lockdown and getting children back to school. So when are we going to see test, track and trace fully amounted, not just the kind of the beginnings of it, but fully implemented? We have seen the new app being tested in the Isle of Wight. We have learned from that experience. One of the things we have learned is we can effectively deploy test, track and trace with the manual tracers. We have recruited 24000 of those already. We will be up to the full complement of 25,000 by 1st June, so the service will be fully operational on 1st June, able to track and trace 10,00from 1st June onwards. The app we think will be ready to deploy a few weeks after that, but the two are complementary and the system will work comprehensively from 1st June, which is one of the government's critical test. You will help us learn more about the way this disease spreads. It will help us stop it spreading any further.

Fiona Bruce
[0:20:54] It is a really important step forward in the way we are dealing with this disease. It is good news.
