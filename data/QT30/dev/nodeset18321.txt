Layla McCay[1:09:00] When we look at this, we think goodness, the moment is here for social care reform. What are we going to do about it? What is the Government going to do about it.Fiona Bruce[1:09:09] Ian.Ian Murray[1:09:10] I think the chronic underfunding of social care across United Kingdom and Scotland, the chickens are coming home to roost. There is a problem for a long time. We need to have some political consensus to fund social care. We have been talking about this for too long. Let's go through what we already knew. We knew the prevalence of this disease was in older people, it was much more severe in older people. We knew from the 2014 Report and Task Force for Social Care that there was 34 recommendations. Very few of them were implemented in Scotland.Ian Murray[1:09:44] We knew in 2015.We knew in 2015 that the Scottish Government had said they would eradicate bed blocking. It was not done. We knew from the Silver Swan Report there was a problem with testing if we had a global pandemic. All of that has since happened and the decision was made by the Scottish Government to move 912 elderly people from hospital to care homes. That in itself is a big decision. It is a decision I completely agree with John, these big decisions have to be made. The key thing is they were taken from hospital to care homes without testing. So we are essentially exporting the disease on the people that it affects the most into care homes.
