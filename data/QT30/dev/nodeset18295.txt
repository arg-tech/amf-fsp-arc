You know, at the moment, in terms of how viable this contact tracing operation is going to be, an awful lot of that does depend on Government communication and that is one of the areas where I think we have seen Boris Johnson actually, you know, fail, and demonstrably so. He does not give the impression of being on top of his brief. He does not inspire public confidence, and that is a significant failing at a time and in a crisis where, you know, communication, clarity and consistency of communication are, if not half the job, then certainly a significant proportion of the Prime Minister's job or First Minister's job or anybody in a leadership position the present.Fiona Bruce[0:32:47] Helen, do you want to respond to that?Helen Whatley[0:32:49] One thing I want to pick up is that the success of the next phase does rely on people being absolutely responsible and coming forwards and booking the test.Fiona Bruce[0:33:00] Just in terms of what Alex was saying in terms of Boris Johnson failing as a communicate or?Helen Whatley[0:33:05] I actually think he is an excellent communicate or and also a very effective at motivating the troops.
