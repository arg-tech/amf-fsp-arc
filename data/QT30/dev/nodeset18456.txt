Fiona Bruce[00:02:52] So, do you think the people were wrong to tear it down then?
Robert Buckland[00:02:55] I think they were. I think that, whilst I absolutely get and understand the huge strength of feeling that’s been engendered as a result of that appalling incident in Minneapolis, and the fact that many people have just had enough, and I get that utterly, I do think that we all owe it to each other to respect the rule of law, and to within that, work for greater equality. And I think the scenes that we saw in Bristol were disturbing, in the sense that there didn’t seem to be that sense of order…
Fiona Bruce[00:03:27] You’re Justice Secretary, do you want to see those people prosecuted?
Robert Buckland[00:03:30] Well I think an investigation is ongoing, and we’ve got to let the police do their job, independently, and let the prosecuting authorities follow the evidence wherever it leads.But, the point I’m making is that if we stand for something together and collectively in this great country, it’s got to be the rule of law, and those values of freedom that attracted so many people here in the first place, and make this country, whilst it is imperfect, and whilst there is a huge amount for us to do, a good place to live, because we have that underpinning of the rule of law and democracy. Let’s celebrate that, but let’s be honest and confront the past as well.
