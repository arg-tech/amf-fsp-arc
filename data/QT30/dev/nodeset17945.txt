Helle Thorning-Schmidt[0:17:24] That's an important point to think about. What is the consequence for children who can't go to school. What we know and I knew that very well when I was CEO of Save the Children, if children don't go to school they basically forget everything they learned the full year.Helle Thorning-Schmidt[0:17:39] We will have children -- I mean for practically lose a whole year of education. They have simply can't remember what they learned six months ago. So I am a little bit worried that if you last too long, we will be taking a little bit of the chirp's future twice. First we will take almost a year of their education an then we are also handing them a very, very large bill for a lockdown which has become very, very expensive. So there is these balances to find but I would just again say find a good balance with also the teachers and take the heat out of it. The only way this can be solved is by being pragmatic.Fiona Bruce[0:18:18] Claire, what do you think of what you have heard? What's your view.Claire Cooper[0:18:23] Well, I quite like Helle's idea of using venues creative leave. I think what I fear is that the value of education will have been taken away from children and I think this is every child. It is children from reception right up to the 6 formers that have lost out on their 'A' levels and are actually grieveing because of that, but also I think what I fear is that there will be a distrust about social contract.Claire Cooper[0:18:54] This term maybe but This term maybe, but going into the next academic year, and I think the value and the trust of the way that schools were before they broke up in the middle of March has disappeared and I feel profoundly sad and worried for those children. I am a syke ol gist. I don't work in education, but I can see the psychological damage that potentially is happening to a whole generation of children.
