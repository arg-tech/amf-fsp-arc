Chris Philp[0:15:55] We will be funding as we normally do. There will be different arrangements for voting. It will not be business as usual but MPs will be doing their job.
Camilla Tominey[0:16:05] What Claire was talking about her question of well being of children and the sense of it will be different when they go back, they will be social distancing, I don't know how the curriculum might match up to what it might have been if we were not in this situation. The bottom line is children miss their friends and miss that social interaction. For children that have been all right at home and are in safe and loving homes, they have been okay and maybe they can last until September with not too much damage. What's happened here, now, is that the government expected 20% attendance levels at schools throughout lockdown. They hoped that all vulnerable children and a lot of children of key workers would attend. Actually what happened is less than 2% of children attended.
Camilla Tominey [0:16:46] I am quite involved with the charity association for the children of alcoholics. Their calls are going through the roof. I did a show with [Unknown] the other day. She was saying childline had been inundated. We have to weigh up the risk here. Yes, there is a risk to children of perhaps contracting COVID-19 and spreading it to vulnerable adults and that's not something we want but what's the risk for vulnerable children for remaining in homes where they may be facing abuse or other problems which greatly affect their well being, much, much more frankly than being socially distanced in a class room.
