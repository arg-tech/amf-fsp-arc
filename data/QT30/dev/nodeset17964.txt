Andy Burnham[0:42:39] What would we lose, fee? These organisations are the fabric baling baling baling baling baling baling baling culture society I want to agree with Camilla, James and Gerald. This is tremendously important. James said sometimes people are squeamish about arts funding. We are not in Greater Manchester. We see the benefit of investing in culture and the arts, what this does to bringing people into the city. We paid our arguments organisations up in advance in tells of advance they were imoing to September go. We have upported artist was. We have set up a streaming plot Orme, united we stream which las been streaming Manchester tal September around the world and the money raised from it supporting venues. You don't need to convince us pa are pa are fee, I want to say also the sporting life of the count reach of the there is this drive to debt the premier league back. I am very worried about what's going to happen to lower league Football Clubs in they have to play behind closed doors. There is lay lot more private money in football. I believe we need to see a premier league setting up a football solid dart fund so the whole the football bier milled can be support the through this. We will see lower league Football Clubs going out of business one after the other. Culture and the arts yes, there is a good case for the government to step in because in the end we have to protect as much of our economy so we can bounce back more quickly but it when this comes to football I think the premier league has to step forward and protect lower league clubs. It will be crucial to keeping up business. Fog fog you have made your appeal. I thinking in Denmark, given the lockdown was relatively short and not particularly strict, was bailing out theatres an issue.
