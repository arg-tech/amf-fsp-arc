Helen Whatley[0:23:37] It is important when you out and about that you are social distancing.Fiona Bruce[0:23:40] Sometimes, as the Government accepted, it is not always going to be possible, particularly in a work environment. When you don't know all the people you have been closer than 2-metre contact with, without the app how are you going to find them?Helen Whatley[0:23:53] I think you will find a lot of people will know people they have spent close contact with for a sustained period of time. That's what you would talk through with the tracers. So they can contact them. This is a known way of dealing with a pandemic and controlling it. So we are not making this up. This is a system that is known to work.Fiona Bruce[0:24:10] Are we ready, Layla?Layla McCay[0:24:12] Well, it sounds as though we are getting there with the human contact tracers, as has been discussed. Clearly it's only just launched. There are going to be operational issues as it starts to bed in.Fiona Bruce[0:24:27] Hang on. We were told it was going to be world beating on Monday by the Prime Minister.Layla McCay[0:24:33] Well, I don't think anyone on the NHS needs it to be world beating so much as really, really effective. That's what we are hoping for. At the moment it has just kicked off. We don't yet know what it's going to be like, but we are strongly hoping that this is going to be a really effective way of working.
