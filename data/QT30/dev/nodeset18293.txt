Fiona Bruce[0:17:45] We are going to move on from Dominic Cummings. Let's hear a question from Matthew Denn.
Matthew[0:17:52] Thank you, Fiona. Track and trace appears to be encountering delay issues in the rolling out process both north and south of the border. Why is it that other nations around the world have managed to expedite these processes and could the Scottish and the UK governments look to adapt using their successes rather than too much re-inventing of the wheel?
Fiona Bruce[0:18:15] Are you referring to things like the app, for example, Matthew? There are apps already being used in Germany, South Korea, other countries, for example, while we are still trying to get ours going. Is that what you mean.
Matthew[0:18:30] Yes. Most reasonable people would concede the Asian countries in particular, whether it was swine flu or SARS, etc, they are probably ahead of the curve because they have gone through pandemics previously. So they have been able to adapt technology but there is plenty of other examples.
Matthew[0:18:46] Dare I say Australia for one where they have been able to roll out this programme of track and trace with great speed from effectively ground zero. When the World Health Organisation said at the start of the global pandemic: "We need a joined-up approach between nations", it almost feels like the UK Government -- reminds me of my father when I was little. You would get lost. He would never ask for directions because he'd a superiority complex about it. It feels that way with the UK at the movement. You know, don't be afraid to ask for a bit of help rather than try to go off on your own tangent.
