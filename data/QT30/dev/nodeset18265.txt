Ian Murray[0:02:21] We absolutely need every single member of the public to be absolutely in touch with these rules and abiding by them, otherwise we will never get to the end of this pandemic. I think it should be called track, trace, test, isolate and trust. The Scottish Government also has a big question to answer here in terms of trust, because if you go back to the start of this pandemic, the ground zeroy pandemic in Edinburgh was at a conference in a hotel. The public weren't told about that. The reason that's a difficult story for the Scottish Government is two-fold. One, you need the public to be involved in this so it can be used to help track and trace the people who potentially would have been infected. You need them to have trust in that system.Secondly, you need that trust from the public so you can use them to isolate and make their own choices about whether or not they see family members. Trust is the nub of how a track and trace system works.
