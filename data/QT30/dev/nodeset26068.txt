I’ll make this final point. People in my constituency, myself, many others, across the United Kingdom have friends and family in Scotland. We remember how divisive the last referendum was. Then we saw the Brexit referendum with all the division that brought. I think people want a period of healing. They want the whole country to be working together. That’s certainly where Keir Starmer is focused. Because if he is prime minister, as I hope he will be, he wants to be prime minister of the whole of the United Kingdom. I think that’s how we’ll tackle these major issues like child poverty, like aspiration and like prosperity to make sure that reaches all parts of our nation.

My father, 100 in two weeks time, was born in Glasgow, my mother in London, my wife’s family came from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Manchester and the south of England. I was in a health service where people came from all over the world and the great science being done in the UK is international. I think my answer is obvious.
