 Coming to Matt's questions, why have other nations done it fasters and could the UK Governments learn from these and do it faster themselves?
Alex Massie[0:31:13] I think on the second part of that it has to be yes. This is one of the many, many things that will be considered by the inevitable series of public enquiries that are going to follow the eventual conclusion of this emergency. You know, one of the ironies here is that, you know, one of the fiercest critics of what you might term disfunction of the British state or the Whitehall apparatus and so on is one Dominic Cummings. He thinks that we need to fundamentally rethink, re-imagine, reorganise the entire bills of Government. I happen to think some of his diagnosis is quite persuasive. He is now in a position to do something about it and he is discovering curing something is rather more difficult than diagnoseing it.
