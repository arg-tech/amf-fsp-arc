Claire Cooper[0:01:27] Hello. Even if some children do get back to school before the end of the summer term, their experience is more likely to be about social distancing and hygiene rather than anything of any educational value. What can the panel suggest for a whole generation of school children who are now missing nearly half an academic year and face months of distrust about social distancing and social contact and the face of further disruption. CLAIRE COOPER:
Fiona Bruce[0:01:58] Andy, let's start with (done) you. There's obviously some schools are going to go back on 1st June. Some are not. What's happening where you are.
Andy Burnham[0:02:07] It is a mixed picture, Fiona. As you say, some are going back. Some have said they would rather take their time to get the right arrangements in place. I agree we want to get the kids back in school if we can as quickly as possible, but it's got to be done as safely as possible. The key thing is here schools haven't closed. It is not as if they have not been doing anything over recent weeks. Of course they have been looking after children of key workers. I think teachers are feeling a bit stressed from the teacher-bashing they have seen this week. I think we need to sort of de-escalate this row a little bit.
Andy Burnham[0:02:45] The problem is the The problem is the government dropped a date on people of 1st June, without any real consultation. I think the way to resolve this is to say to head teachers in consultation with councils "Try to get back by 1st June but as soon as you feel is safe as possible". That feels to me to be the right resolution from where we are today.
