Fiona Bruce [1:05:13] Let me just turn to Layla for a moment. Hearing what John and Alex is saying, there were other countries before us grappling with this. They admitted people from hospitals back into care homes. In some cases in some countries they put them into quarantine, special places or quarantine within care homes. Is there anything we could have learned from that reasonably or is Alex right, this is the best we could have done in the circumstances?
Layla McCay [1:05:42] It is incredibly hard to say. I look at what other countries have done. As you say, there's been some sort of quarantine centres or interim places to go. It is not exactly clear. I mean, obviously what has happened with COVID-19 and care homes has been an absolute tragedy, but the reasons for that are not quite as clear-cut as sometimes people are assuming.
Layla McCay [1:07:22] So we hear people say, "Oh, it is because everyone was sent out of hospital", but actually when you look at the data, it is not totally clear that that was something that has created this challenge, in fact.
