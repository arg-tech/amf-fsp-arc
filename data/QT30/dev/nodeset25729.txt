Fiona Bruce[0:20:42] Now the list has been increased today of countries on the green list, in terms of very popular holiday destinations for British tourists, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, they are still on the amber list.
Kate Andrews[0:20:56] Look, I think it's a bit rich for this Government to be talking about continuing to curb our ability to travel in and out of the countries so greatly when its own ministers were traveling during the first lockdown. You had Foreign Minister Wendy Morton in Greece in April taking a lovely tour in Athens to talk about climate change. You had Greg Hands in March in Croatia, he did a tour in Slovenia I think as well. He flew back to the England where two people were just about to be allowed to sit on a park bench together. Ministers and special advisers haven't had to quarantine in this process and haven't had to do testing if they don't want to. This feeds into the idea of one rule for some and a different rule for others. But, I almost have to take issue with the premise of the question because as somebody who has had their first jab and very excited to get their second I think we still have a few issues here. We are always going to be living with the hypothetical of a new variant, and again we should be on top of this, and we should be concerned if there really is evidence it can undermine the vaccines.
