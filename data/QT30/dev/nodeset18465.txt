Fiona Bruce [00:25:52] Okay. Alright, let’s…this is a subject we could talk about for the entire programme, I know. There were lots of other questions that came in as well, on other things, so I’m just going to move on now, to Rosina Allen?
Female Aud 3[00:26:05] Hello. Good evening. Like myself and many other independent restaurants, our restaurant is very much family based, and five of our family members are dependant on that business. Since Covid-19 has come around, social distancing seems to inevitable in hospitality. Once lockdown is lifted, we imagine 25 to 50 per cent of our capacity will only be achieved, and we feel that only fixed costs may be covered, or may not be covered. In the short term and the longterm, what strategies will the government and stakeholder organisations put forward for our industry, taking into account there’s so much debt already been created by independent family business now?
Fiona Bruce [00:26:59] And Rosina, you mentioned social distancing, of course two metres in this country is the acceptable social distancing. Rocco, I’m going to come to you obviously, first, with your hotel business.
Rocco Forte [00:27:08] Well, yes, this two metre social distancing rule has sort of come out of the blue, there’s no scientific evidence behind it. The WTO has just come out and said, if you’re two metres away you have a one per cent chance of catching the disease, and if you’re one metre away you have a three per cent chance of catching the disease.
