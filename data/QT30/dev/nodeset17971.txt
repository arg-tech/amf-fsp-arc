Chris Philp[0:46:50] First of all I completely accept everything that James and Gerald are saying about the importance of the arts sector. Clearly it is a huge economic contributor as James very powerly set out but it is so much more than that. it enriches our cultural lives. It gives entertainment, meaning. It attracts tourists to this country fog fog 

Camilla Tominey so given that, can you see the government extending a helping hand.

Chris Philp[0:47:12] Let me take the question in two part. In terms of what we have done already I would strongly encourage every arts organisation to use all of the existing schemes. James mentioned the for other scheme already. Every organisation in the position, for example, of theatre should be using that scheme to have their staff who can't work paid at 80% of their Sarl each. Government is funding that and has recently extended it. There are significant loan schemes available under the government backed loan schemes that have paid out now over Â£20 billion. Again I would encourage the arts to use that fog fog there is no question the government has made a massive outlay when it comes to support small business. There are a lot of people employed in the theatre who can't access the for owe scheme and lot of theatres are saying the loans don't apply to them which is why they are asking for the money. Is there anything additional the government can do.
