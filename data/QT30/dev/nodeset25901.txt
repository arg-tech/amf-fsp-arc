And Judith?

Yes, thank you. I work in the biotech industry and I would say the health care system in Scotland, or in the UK for that matter, is not prepared for what is coming. There is a tsunami of conditions that are coming our way. I work particularly in Alzheimer’s disease. And Alzheimer’s disease was a leading cause of death in the UK up until COVID took over, but recently, with the decline in COVID deaths, Alzheimer’s disease has once again taken that unfortunate top spot.But there’s a number of diseases, whether it’s chronic neurological diseases or neurodegenerative diseases, the consequences of cardiovascular disease, which are still growing, cancers which are still an issue. And then we’re dealing with the mental health issues and we’re also dealing, on top of that, with the diseases that haven’t been adequately treated during the COVID pandemic because some many resources have been directed towards COVID.
