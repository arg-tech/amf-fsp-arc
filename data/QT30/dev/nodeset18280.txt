Helen Whatley [0:14:06] The guidance has always said that safety would be a factor and you should be clearly a responsible parent. I think what's really important is that people follow the guidance and through doing that that's how we manage to keep the infection rate under control, and so life can get back to normal, or closer to normal, which would be so much better for everybody.
Ian Murray [0:14:25] Keith is partially right, why we have not moved on is there has been no apology, no contrition. The doubling down on saying you can drive 60 miles to test your eyesight and Michael Gove's touring television studies to say that is allowable because he was preparing to go back to work is treating the public like fools. That's why people have not moved on.

John Swinney [0:14:52] The whole issue for me comes down to the point when Dominic Cummings made this journey everybody was told "you have got to stay at home". The reasons why you were able to leave home were really, really, really limited. Quite clearly Dominic Cummings broke those rules to make the journey that he made. Ian Murray is absolutely right. The ludicrous explanation, the thing you do when you are worried about your eyesight is drive your car for 60 miles is just beyond credibility.
