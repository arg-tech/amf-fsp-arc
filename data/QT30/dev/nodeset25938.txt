And just to be very precise about the Equality Human Rights
Commission report, it found political interference in antisemitism complaints.
Didn’t use the word cover up. But political interference nonetheless. Nick, this
is not a comfortable day for you I would imagine. You also were part of the
front bench during all of this. What do you have to say?

Well, firstly this is a shameful day for the Labour party.
We accept the findings of the Equality and Human Rights report in their
entirety, and we will act on the recommendations. But first and foremost I want
to acknowledge the hurt that has been caused to the Jewish community over the
past five years. Kier Starmer has expressed our profound sorrow for this. We
are profoundly sorry for that hurt that has been caused. Today’s report, it’s
an appalling, damning report that is before us, but we now have to act upon the
recommendations of that report. I never thought I’d be sitting on your show,
Fiona, after the last Labour government created the Equality and Human Rights
Commission and actually be speaking about an investigation in findings into the
Labour party itself, but that’s where we are. We will now work to ensure that
yes, our complaints processes are improved, that they are independent, they are
where they should be. But we will do more than that. The answer to this isn’t
just about process, important though that is, it’s about changing the culture
of our party so that it is a place where everybody feels welcome and everybody
feels safe. What Kier Starmer has done today with a decisive speech of moral clarity is to show the way towards that. I know there is a long way to go, but Keir’s speech and our commitment to taking action on this is the start of that road.
