It is why, even though patience is beginning to wear thin, I think there is still a residual degree of goodwill for the Government, if the Government can be shown to be responsive to this situation, can show that it is accepting and taking ownership of mistakes, and the care home situation is clearly one of them. You can't go around prattling on about how you are throwing a protective ring around care homes at the same time as thousands and thousands of people are dying in care homes.

It is clear for a long, long time care homes have been sort of overlooked, too often forgotten part of the whole health and social care network, and sometimes perhaps seen as a convenient place to park people whose presence elsewhere might be deemed undesirable or too complicated.
