Grant Shapps[0:37:58] With the exception of isolated cases, we managed to get the PPE there. I'm trying to answer this as honestly as possible for you. It wasn't a satisfactory situation that we didn't have domestic production, everybody was trying to get the same PPE. We were prepared for a flu pandemic, different types of PPE. Only a fool would say you wouldn't look back on this and say there are things we wished we had, pieces of equipment we had, and if it was starting again from today we would have it, not least because we're manufacturing here.Fiona Bruce[0:38:28] Just to be clear, you think he was right to say that there wasn't a national PPE shortage?Grant Shapps[0:38:34] I think he was quoting from the NHS providers, or from the chair of the Public Accounts Committee who said that this was a benchmark for procurement exercise in getting PPE. 32 billion pieces of PPE.Fiona Bruce[0:38:52] Okay. You are saying he is right?Grant Shapps[0:38:54] Remember this. The government has never, ever been responsible for providing PPE to the care sector. The government actually managed to complete the purchase so that the care sector was receiving it as well in addition to all the hospitals.
