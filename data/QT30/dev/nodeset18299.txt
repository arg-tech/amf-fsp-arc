Fiona Bruce[0:55:58] For someone in Jeanette's position specifically, she's come on the programme and said what are you going to do for people like me and who work for people like that. What is the Government going to do.

Helen Whatley[0:56:09] I can't pre-empt the decision the Chancellor will make on that but it is absolutely true we need to make sure people are able to afford what they need in life and recognise the costs of this. Also we do need to have something which is economically sustainable. So we need to have a way to be beginning to restart the economy, because of the huge amount of economic support that has gone to those who are in employment, in businesses, across the economy, a huge amount of support. We now need to get the economy back up and running and more people going back to work.

Fiona Bruce[0:56:44] I am sure Jeanette will wait with great interest to see what comes out. As the Prime Minister said today, "We will look after everybody locally who is affected by this". Let's see what happens.
