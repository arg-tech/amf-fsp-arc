Bernadine Evaristo You know, a lot of people in this country don’t understand the colonial history, or they understand it through a certain prism, where they feel that Britain went and travelled all over the world, in order to help people. You know, there is still a section of society who don’t think slavery was a really bad thing.So, I think it’s really important that we interrogate history and when you have to take the law into your hands and remove a statue, I mean, God, nobody died, you know, it’s just this little tin statue, whatever it was, that was thrown into the river, and it then led to this conversation that we’re having now, about the rest of the relics of Britain’s murky past, then I think it’s really important.Fiona Bruce [00:08:49] And when Tessa talks about removing statues or portraits of anyone who has profited from Empire? I’m sort of wondering where does that…Bernadine Evaristo [00:08:59] Well…that’s the country, that’s the country isn’t it?Fiona Bruce [00:09:01] Yes, exactly.Bernadine Evaristo [00:09:02] But I think the visual symbols, the statues are really toxic, and they really are an affront to our shared humanity, and I think at least we need to look at that. And, do you know, Britain was built on the wealth of slavery and colonialism, that’s the truth. And we don’t really admit that.
