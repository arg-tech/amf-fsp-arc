Liz Saville-Robert [00:17:31] So, the question that I have for us now, is how are we going to bring about the big social changes, the big changes in attitudes? That’s why the statues are so interesting, because they are so symbolic of a certain sort of history that said the Empire was fine, that the British Empire was a force for good, and a force for good only in the world. This is not true. And now is the time to come to recognise that it isn’t just the history of powerful white men, who often made their money and their fortunes out of the sufferings of others. Now is the time for the voice of the others to come through. And that is my hope for the future, that the fact that we’re having this discussion here, it has to go beyond the usual talking heads of politicians, and get into our curriculum, and really change people’s attitudes.
