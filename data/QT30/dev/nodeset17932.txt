Fiona Bruce[0:32:52] Alfie, this was your question. Are you confident that it will be the test, track and trace will be fully embedded by June 1st. What prompted your question in the first place.Alfie[0:33:02] I am a computer science student. My experience of software engineering is things do go wrong. They go often wrong and we are running out of time. If you want to launch an app on the same day that schools open, you are asking for the worst.Fiona Bruce[0:33:19] It sounds like we are probably not going to get the app on June 1st. I am just wondering if it is a question of interpretation. You have Alfie saying "when will test, track and trace be fully embedded". You are saying June 1st. You have Andy saying it will get going on June 1st but fully embedded, all bells and whistles, no. Which is it in your crew.Chris Philp[0:33:44] The 25,000 people who are needed to operate the system and deliver 10,000 track and traces per day will be in place by 1st June. Â£24,000 of those 25,000 have been recruited already and are in advance stages of training, so will be ready to deploy on 1st June. As you said, Fiona, the app will be a few weeks after that, which will further augment the system. We will also learn a lot more about Coronavirus by using it but we are going to be ready to go on 1st June. It will really help us understand how the disease spreads. It will help us control it, identify people who are this danger of catching it and get them quarantined and then tested really
