Fiona Bruce[1:00:09] Let's hear from Elaine in the audience. You have had your hand up for a short while now.
Elaine[1:00:15] I agree with Alex. I think at the start of this pandemic it was a tsunami and nobody knew what they would do. I think we saw the horrific pictures of the Italian hospitals where patients were in corridors and couldn't catch a breath.
Elaine[1:00:38] I think the right decision was made at the time to make sure the hospitals were clear so we wouldn't have those images in our newspapers. I think Nicola Sturgeon has looked back, like Alex said there, and thought -- hindsight is a great thing -- probably would have done things differently. I think the choice at the time having that tsunami of patients with COVID versus letting elderly patients go into a care home, we would have probably thought that was going to be a safer place for them at the time. It was a lose/lose choice now that we look back at the time to try to get away from those images we were seeing all over the press with people not getting a hospital bed. It didn't come to that, which is a good thing. So I think it is a lose/lose. It is an unfortunate situation.
