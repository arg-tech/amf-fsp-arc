Sean[0:27:07] I am just wondering how useful this app will be. Dr Hannah Fry said in 2017 it is time for the next pandemic like this. Most of the things that were coming out from that were about access to wi-fi, having the money to pay for wi-fi, wi-fi in your home, whether you have a phone that would be able to have this app and you would be able to download it. My mum is over 70. I don't know if she would be able to navigate something like that.

David[0:27:39] I think there was a guy there. (Inaudible). The First Minister of Scotland said she was reticent to announce the moving from lockdown in Scotland. I understand where she is coming from. We have got to a point for me personally -- I may not be her biggest fan but her coming out at 12.30 every day, talking to us personally, giving us the brief she has given us and then for the Westminster Parliament to do what has happened over the last few weeks and say what they have said and give that mistrust, nobody is going to say -- the Government (inaudible) that people could get to the start. It is not like anything else that has ever happened. This pandemic has hit us all hard.
David[0:28:30] The trust has gone and I don't understand how you can sit there, Helen, and turn around and say to us that we've got to get the pandemic in control. You need the public on your side and that's not what we have seen from the Westminster Government.
