Camilla Tominey[0:27:52] There was an argument if you think about it, it was only the week before and rightly or wrongly, and decisions will now be made about future events, but only the week before there were thousands at Cheltenham. So every step of the way the government has had to look at the psychology of the public. Having said that, I spoke to a Tory MP this week who likened the confusion over time and perhaps everything seeming back to front to that Morecambe and Wise sketch with Andrew Previn, where he says "You are not playing all of the right notes". Eric Morecambe says "I am playing all the right notes, just not necessarily in the right order". From a public perspective, people have asked themselves "why are you doing this now". The quarantine thing, frips, people are saying, you are quarantineing flights now to fog.
Fiona Bruce[0:28:40] Not yet but talking about.
Camilla Tominey[0:28:43] Soon. Why didn't you quarantine at the beginning of this crisis? The messaging from the Prime Minister addressing the public about the loosening of the restrictions before releasing the paperwork describing how people should go back to work seemed to be the wrong way around. The test, track and trace it is great we have this technology, but that exercise, Signus, did identify very years ago the problems that would be faced by this country in the event of a global pandemic.
Camilla Tominey[0:29:11] People will be askinging why has the fileing come so late. Why is it countries like South Korea were on top of this at the beginning of the pandemic hitting their nation whereas we only to be getting to GRIPS with some of that technological response at the end of it.
