Fiona Bruce[0:41:17] How can you put a date on it. We can't predict how everything is going to go Camilla ka Camilla everything is conditional. What happened is we heard about things happening in June and hair dressers maybe going back into business, thank goodness, in July. We didn't hear anything about terror other cultural events. You know, gition and concerts. Now a appreciate they are at the end of the scale, because they are mass gatherings and that's what's completely advised against right now but if there were just a window, because I know from pie own experience around I am sure the panel I wases all agree, I wouldn't mind booking in some things to look forward to at comaches. That would give the industry a lifeline if they were able to open booking from a certain time. I appreciate the science is not straightforward. I feel they have been cast adrift somewhat. It is no wonder James and his come eetion in that sthee are in complete limbo not knowing when they can get baa being not just so normal but the new normal everybody is talking about fog fog we have James and Camilla suggesting a bail out. And eep, can the government afford it. Rishi Sunak is talking about a recession we have never known coming down the track and is spending an absolute fortune on supporting companies and if you recall owe schemes. Can we really afford to support theefters as well.
