Fiona Bruce[1:01:28] Okay. Rina, you wanted to come back in. You asked the question.Rina[1:01:32] Thanks very much. I think in terms of the planning, you know, we have known about this since the end of December, beginning of January. I know it is not a long time. What has been clear from the very start is the most vulnerable in the communities is elderly. We let people leave hospitals without being tested and put them into care homes. We put them back into their own homes to be cared for by home care workers or by support agencies or by family and nobody was tested.Rina[1:02:03] So I know there was tough decisions and I am not just talking about the Scottish Government. I am talking about generally across the UK. I know we were flooded with pictures with it. Maybe when the cameras went in and out of care homes would they be flooded with as many pictures with people dying in care homes horrenously. There is no winners in this. I know it's been difficult. I know the whole thing is new to us. I just think they are the most vulnerable and they are always I feel the first to be forgotten, you know.We have clapped and we applauded Captain Tom and many of his generation have just been left to die in care homes. I just think it's outrageous.
