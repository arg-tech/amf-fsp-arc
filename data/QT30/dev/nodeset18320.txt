Fiona Bruce[0:43:10] If you have just beenHelen Whatley[0:51:10] You are being asked to isolate, self-isolate at home -- asking everyone in the household to isolate, but it is during that period in the possible incubation period to see whether you might contract the virus. I recognise there is a risk that you might be asked to do that more than once, but if people follow social distancing, if people are following social distancing and minimising their contact, so if they are having to go to a work place to work but social distancing in the work place is really important, because that's how you avoid becoming somebody who is a contact of the sort that needs to isolate.Fiona Bruce[0:51:49] In England you can go to barbecues now. I think in Scotland, correct me if I am wrong you can't.Ian Murray[0:51:55] Yes, you can.Fiona Bruce[0:51:58] You can go to barbecues.Ian Murray[0:51:59] You can. Two households, no more than eight people. It is eight people. It is six in England. Two households can meet, socially distanced in public or private, outdoor spaces. So you could have a barbecue -- this is how ridiculous this situation is. It is 8 in Scotland, 6 in England. Why don't we get a common approach.
