Fiona Bruce[0:26:03] Eleanor, you wanted to come in.
Eleanor[0:26:06] Yes. Just taking that last point as well, there is a huge disconnect between what we hear on the daily briefings and the reality and the implementation of these policies on the ground and, you know, having that confidence in the infrastructure can deliver what we are being promised.
Eleanor[0:26:26] It's really incomprehensible why the UK was so unprepared. I mean, countries like Turkey have been testing and tracking since the start with a relatively low death toll and indeed, as you were saying in the Panel, we were told we would get a world beating system, but what has been rolled out now is the basics of what we should have expected weeks ago.We are not testing asymptomatic cases. Tests are only available online. they should be available locally I would have thought. It just appears that once again the world has beaten us to it.
