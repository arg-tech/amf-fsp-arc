Fiona Bruce[0:10:51] This will be music to your ears, Helen.
Helen Whatley[0:10:53] Well, yes, and Keith's position is more I am beginning to hear coming through, that people feel there's been a lot of talk about what Dominic Cummings did or didn't do, but actually what really matters is us having the pandemic under control and being able to get back to life much newer to normal.
Fiona Bruce[0:11:13] Is that what your constituents were saying to you when it when it first broke, this story.
Helen Whatley[0:11:19] Of course I have received e-mails from constituents, as every MP has, constituents who have talked about some of the sacrifices they have made and things they have missed out on. I don't think we should suggest for a moment that lockdown is anything other than very hard.That is why what's really important is that we now have the infection rate under control and falling and that we are in a position to ease some of the lockdown measures, and launching NHS test and trace, as referred to by Alison, because that is so important to continuing to keep it under control so we can get life going again.
