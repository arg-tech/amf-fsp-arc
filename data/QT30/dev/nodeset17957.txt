Fiona Bruce[0:20:59] Just to be clear, there have been a number of deadlines that have slipped. You are sounding very confident, possibly rightly so. I am in no position to judge, very confident on 1st June it is going to hit the ground running. South Korea is alway cited as the great example of contact tracing. They had a flare up in the night club at the beginning of the month. They traced 60,000 people to find 170 new infections. Each one was quarantined. Is that the kind of level of contact tracing the government is going to be able to do from 1st June?
Chris Philp[0:21:37] The capacity will be 10,000 traces every day. The Prime Minister in the house of Commons on Wednesday was categoric. We need to be ready to go on 1st June. We need 25,000 people to do it. 24000 have been recruited already. We will get to 25,000 by 1st June. We are going to get there.
Fiona Bruce[0:21:57] The app seems to be having a few teething problems. Having the app is not critical to contact tracing? It sounded as if it was the next big thing.
Chris Philp[0:22:09] Experience in the Isle of Wight shows you can do effective contatracing without the app, the app is helpful, it adds something to it, and we will get that in a few weeks' time. There are all sorts of other innovations happening. Matt Hancock talked about a test being deployed today that gives you a result in 20 minutes. We have had advances in antibody testing today as well. So the science is really beginning to catch up with this disease. For me the science is really what gives me hope for the future, hope we can move beyond the strange circumstances of the last few weeks and return to something of a normal life, as the months go by.
