Fiona Bruce[1:13:18] John Swinney, you wanted to come in. We are almost out of time. I wanted to let you have another word.
John Swinney[1:13:27] The point I wanted to make was that in Ian's last answer he talked about the need for there to be measures to tackle delayed discharges. Then when the Government tackles the issue of delayed discharges, we get criticised for it by Ian Murray.
John Swinney[1:13:42] There are really difficult decisions that have had to be taken here with the best interests of the population at heart, tough decisions in tough circumstances.Many of the measures we have taken have supported care homes to make sure that individuals have had the resources and the equipment and the assistance in place to make sure we are kept safe in very difficult situations.
Fiona Bruce[1:14:05] I am afraid our hour is up. I want to say, Eleanor, I see you have your hand up there. We have run out of time. Forgive me for not coming to you.
