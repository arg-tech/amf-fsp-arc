Fiona Bruce [00:21:52] Patrick. You have your hand up

[Patrick]: Thank you. I’ve only ever been involved from the periphery with the regulatory process of medicine, but as I understand it, the MRHA have run some of the phases and steps in parallel with each other rather than sequentially with some overlap between them and that’s what shortened everything. But I think the MRHA is an institution with a significant international reputation that will stand by having done that. It can justify not having cut any corners. I feel quite confident in what they’ve done.

Fiona Bruce [00:22:26] Mathew T, I’m calling you Mathew T because we have two Matthews in our audience
 
Matthew T [00:22:34] Instead of saying crass comments, how would the Panel suggest we should collaborate with other nations better during this whole vaccine roll-

Fiona Bruce [00:22:44] That is a big question. Liam, feel free to tackle that, but the original question, has our departure from the European Union speeded up the process?

Liam Halligan [00:22:54] In response to the original question, people can take from this what they will. It’s kind of depressing that we’re still fighting the referendum of June 2016 even at this late stage. As a point of fact, the EU could have invoked emergency powers to speed up the emergency process but it chose not to. If we were still part of the European Union we would be part of that collective decision. We decided to not be part of that and that’s why, as a point of fact, we were able to approve this vaccine slightly quicker.
