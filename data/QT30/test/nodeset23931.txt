Jonathan Ashworth[0:02:54] Yes, for those who are vaccinated, the link between hospitalisations and deaths has been reduced but it's not been severed, and many of those people who get the virus today, tomorrow, next week even if they don't end up in hospital, although some of them will. Many of them will live with long-term serious conditions, debilitating conditions, whether it's fatigue, memory loss, anxiety, and depression. For some, it presents as hair loss, teeth loss. Some suffer psychosis, it remains a serious deadly virus, we should not be complacent! I believe this particular decision around the final at Wembley is complacent. We have got to change it.
