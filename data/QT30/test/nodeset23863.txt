Fiona Bruce[0:32:32] Everyone may not be familiar with the court case. In brief outline, remind everybody what it is you were trying to do.
Hugh Osmond[0:32:40] We were seeking a judicial review of the decision to delay opening of hospitality. As I say, unfortunately, after an unexplained two-week delay from the court, the judgment was that it was academic because it wouldn't make a difference before 17 May. I can tell you, it's absolutely not academic for the 3 million people who work in hospitality. On the very same day after the court made its decision and it came out afterwards, there was published quietly by the government a full report from SAGE based on UK information throughout the epidemic that said it found no evidence that pubs and restaurants or hospitality in general were -- to infection. While it is dead easy, I can understand people believing in the beginning that pubs might be, this report said there was no evidence of that. They slipped it out just after the decision not to reopen. On the back of that and on the fact that all the data are well ahead of that predicted by Imperial and by Warwick in their models, I cannot see why hospitality is not open. It is an immense disappointment for an industry that spent a huge amount responding to COVID, lost a huge amount. We employ 3 million people, mainly under 25. They need to get back to work. It is a disgrace. The data and science have at no point supported the government on this.
