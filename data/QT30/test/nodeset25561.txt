Fiona Bruce[0:19:14] You had a job, which is now gone. Are you working at all at the moment?
Imran Anwoir[0:19:18] Yeah, so I am currently working in food supply, it was my part time supply at university and luckily I didn't hand in my notice so I can still work there.
Fiona Bruce[0:19:30] What? A supermarket or something like that?
Imran Anwoir[0:19:32] Yeah, yeah.
Fiona Bruce[0:19:34] Just out of interest, hands up of our audience, how many of you are either out of work or have been furloughed? Right. Okay. What's going to happen to young people, Steve? Boris Johnson talked about they should all have apprenticeships. A lot of people seem to be taken by surprise. Is that going to happen?
