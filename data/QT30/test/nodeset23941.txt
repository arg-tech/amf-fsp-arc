Kate Andrews[0:15:16] The science says vaccines work, they are more effective than we ever dreamed they could be. Especially against the Delta variant, Charlie from the audience is completely right Covid patients are taking up roughly 1% of hospital beds right now, and the stats Victor pointed out we have very serious problems about waiting lists and that's another topic. But in terms of capacity, this isn't particularly abnormal for the NHS that's what you get with a rationing system that doesn't supply as many resources. The issue with this isn't that we are being too cautious, it's that we are picking and choosing who gets their liberty back. We are picking and choosing who gets to be free. If you enjoy the football and you happen to get a ticket and you happen to be somebody who is wealthy enough that's on a list defined as a VIP then you get to enjoy yourself. If you would like to go to the theatre or have friends around to your home for a birthday party, you still can't do that. That's the problem. We are projecting to the world with the G7 with the football that Britain is open that everything is back to normal, that it looks something like Israel does, thanks to their vaccine success as well. We could be like that! But we all know the reality at the moment is actually quite different.
