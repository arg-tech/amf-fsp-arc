Jed Mercurio[00:30:20] They’ve kind of been shut out, whether intentionally or not I don’t know, but they do feel that they’ve been shut out. And that does then limit us in terms of our ability to do exactly what we’re all asking for.
As Steve said, where’s that can do attitude? Can we crush this virus so that society can get back to normal and our kids can get back into school and our businesses can get up and running? And a lot of the businesses and the particular sectors that are looking to get back, frankly, don’t have much confidence.

Fiona Bruce[00:31:30] And what about your business? I mean, getting Line of Duty – I say that as an unashamed fan I have to confess, of getting that back up and running?

Jed Mercurio[00:31:37] Well, it’s interesting that you give that specific example because we had an outbreak during the shoot over in Belfast when there was the test and trace system originally, the containment phase, and we were able to deal with that and we were able to carry on uninterrupted. Then, towards the end of the shoot that got curtailed, we had another outbreak and I was quite surprised to learn that we weren’t able to do testing and tracing, that the system had been stopped. And that was the point where really when we looked at it, we knew that we couldn’t protect our workforce and we had to stop, and that was nine days before the lockdown. So the writing was on the wall then.
