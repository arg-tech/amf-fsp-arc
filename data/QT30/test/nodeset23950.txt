Jonathan Ashworth[0:26:48] Robert says we have to follow the evidence. Let's see the evidence because there has been some alternative evidence today a study from Cambridge which suggests that a cohort of health workers who had been double-jabbed, an international study led by Cambridge, but double-jabbed health workers, caught the virus and transmitted the virus. So vaccination in and of itself does not make you bullet-proof. It's a tremendous success.
Fiona Bruce[0:27:22] Do you think more people shouldn't be going on holiday?
Jonathan Ashworth[0:27:24] I think we have to proceed with caution for now until we fully understand what is happening with this particular Delta variant. We shouldn't be here. It's because as Caroline said we have the red-listing it, but we are where we are, and Boris Johnson gave it the red carpet. There's been a mutation, there's been a mutation in the Delta variant where it has a particular new strain that's been identified in around 40 cases in the UK.
Fiona Bruce[0:27:50] To be clear, the Labour position is not that more people should be going on holiday the reverse?
Jonathan Ashworth[0:27:56] The Labour position is we should always follow the clinical evidence. I do not understand what the clinical evidence is for this decision. We know even with a double jab you are still at risk from this variant. I want to see what the clinical evidence is.
