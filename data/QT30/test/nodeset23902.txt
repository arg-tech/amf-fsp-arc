Yanis Varoufakis[0:24:24] As far as I'm concerned, especially given the great success of your vaccination programme, unlike the European Union's fiasco, our rate of vaccination has reached 20% of fully vaccinated people in Greece, it is pathetic. Given your success, it is important not to continue with lockdowns, but to invest a lot of effort, money as well, in suppressing the virus, in persuading people to get vaccinated, in tracking and tracing those who are not and, you know, doing the hard work of carrying the population with you. That, for me, is the number one priority for Britain now.Frank Luntz[0:25:08] Also give them the evidence. Virtually every doctor has gotten vaccinated. Why? Because they know the facts. They know the information. It is not enough to say, "You should do it." You have to give them facts behind it, that the vaccinations are safer than what we take for the flu and more effective. That you have a responsibility, not just to yourselves, your family and your friends and your community, we have to make the case. They have to know the facts and when they do, they will choose vaccinations.
