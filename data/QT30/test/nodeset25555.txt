Theo Paphitis[0:02:24] We will never be back to normal until we get one or two things: A vaccine or a successful treatment. When we have got those two things, we can get back to normal. Until then, we will be under control one way or another, and we better stick to it. Otherwise we will be on total be lockdown.Fiona Bruce[0:02:42] We stay stick to it. Jess Phillips, the rules are pretty complex now and they are different in different parts of the UK. Is it not time to allow people to make decisions about how they want to approach the situation?Jess Phillips[0:02:56] Look, I mean that's ultimately what we want for everybody, we want everybody to feel free and be able to go around and do how they would have done prior to lockdown. But, I mean, where I live, lots and lots of people have died and all over the country that is the case, but in areas like the one I represent, which has large proportions of poorer communities and BMA communities, we have seen terrible rates of deaths and so, as Theo said, these controls were to try and keep us safe.
