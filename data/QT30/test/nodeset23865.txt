Fiona Bruce[0:35:58] The government said it would be driven by data not dates. The next day opening up in England is 17 May. The data is looking very favourable. Why can the government not open up sooner in hospitality?
Robert Jenrick[0:36:10] You're right that the data we have seen is very positive. The Prime Minister said that himself. It looks as if we will be able to move forward with the next stage of the roadmap on 17 May. There's nothing at the moment that would suggest we're not also able to move forward on 21 June with the next stage of the roadmap.
Fiona Bruce[0:36:28] But to Hugh's point --
Robert Jenrick[0:36:34] It is right to stick to what we created. You gather the data, you ensure there is a five-week wait which gives enough time to have the information on which to make an informed decision, then you have time to make the public and businesses like Hugh's. No one is saying this is easy. None of us would want to have these measures in place for a day longer than is necessary, but I think it is right, having done so much -- I mean, having all these difficult decisions to be cautious at this stage in the process. We are trying to do everything we can to support in England and the rest of the United Kingdom where we can the hospitality sector. If you think through what we've done, we have the business rates holiday that's continuing, we have grants up to Â£18,000 --
