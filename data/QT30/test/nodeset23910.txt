[0:35:32] Thank you, Fiona. I think the chap on the panel has got it right. Let's stop politicising this and let's work out what it is that we need to do. Lots of people are putting money into this but what is it we're trying to achieve here? Pounds after pounds and euros after euros and dollars after dollars are going into this pot, and all we're saying is more needs to be delivered. More needs to be delivered. Where is it going? Who is getting it? Let's have some feedback to the good that's being done and maybe we can go to the next step and say let's put our hands in our pockets even more.

[0:36:18] The direction of change is all important. You see, it is very different to say that, okay, let's find out whether we should be spending more money on a shelter for battered women in the Sudan or victims of a civil war. It is another to say we have been funding these centres and now we're going to turn these people out on to the street or the dirt, and that's an obnoxious decision to make. This is the definition of a false saving.
