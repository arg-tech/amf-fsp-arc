Kavita Oberoi[0:42:30] There was lots of racism towards players. From a personal perspective, growing up in the 1970s, I was called a Paki and abused on a daily basis at school. Okay. As I got through the 80s and 90s, I felt that happened less. It wasn't a nice thing, okay, and we're still getting this in this day and age and I think, you know, if the footballers, celebrities, have got a platform to raise this, and drive a change, that's what we need. We saw Marcus Rashford drive the change with the schools and he drove a policy change, and we need the Government to get behind this, to drive changes and change people's mindset because we shouldn't be now still experiencing all that racism, because I know what it feels like.Fiona Bruce[0:43:18] Rose.AudienceMember 20210805QT22[0:43:22] I just think it is so important because it keeps the conversation going. That's what the movement is about, keeping those conversations and making the changes that we need to accept that we can all be slightly discriminatory in the way we behave in society and just keep that conversation at the forefront.
