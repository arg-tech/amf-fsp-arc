Fiona Bruce [0:41:58] I mean, George, obviously you have talked about the Robert Genrik situation already, but in terms of social housing overall?
George Mpanga [0:42:08] For a while, as has been alluded to, the stock of social housing has been slipping into the private sector. A lot of times it's in negotiations that the community have not been privy to. Yes, in 2018, the Government did mandate that, for developments above a certain number, communities need to be consulted. That is a welcome change. But there is something more pernicious that has been happening in the reduction of the social housing stock for a while.
Fiona Bruce [0:42:36] Quite of few of you have hands up. Katie?
Katie [0:42:40] Hi. I happen to live in an area of Worcestshire that has quite a lot of green belt. Whilst we do need a lot more houses, we need to be environmental about it. There is a lot of houses that are run down and there is buildings that we could knock down and rebuild where they are and make them, obviously, I think, as Iona was saying, better than the new-builds that are currently being built. Why on earth are contracts trying to be taken out on green belts which should be protected environmentaly when there are brown belt places and places that should be knocked down and built with better houses, surely would make better use of the space that's there.
