Do you reckon Rob, do you think there’s a correlation between the confidence in how the government’s dealt with this pandemic and connecting that with the third that doesn’t give any of their details with the Track and Trace?Fiona Bruce [00:49:26] I love the fact that Ross is calling you Rob as well, we’re getting fantastically informal here.Robert Buckland [00:49:30] That’s alright Ross, thank you very much, a lot of people do. I think it’s a very important point. I talked about confidence, I think, a little earlier on.Fiona Bruce [00:49:39] But, do you think he’s right?Robert Buckland [00:49:40] I think that we’ve got to ask ourselves the question, are people doing it because they don’t want to cooperate, that they value, perhaps their own privacy or…Fiona Bruce [00:49:49] Or, loss of trust, that’s what Ross is asking.
