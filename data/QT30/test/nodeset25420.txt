Vaughan Gething [00:14:16] And in doing that, it’s not just examining our distant past, it’s not even about trying to re-write our history, it’s understanding our history to help deal with our future. And the way politicians talk about this matters. So, I think the Prime Minister would be in a better position to do his job, if he recognised that at the start of the 21st century, talking about watermelon smiles and piccaninnies was not helpful, he was an MP at the time. The same for the leader of Plaid Cymru, [inaudible 00:15:40] in the recent past, too. We can all learn from this, and take the opportunity in this extraordinary global movement, to reset, not just our view on our past, but much more importantly to make changes to our shared future.Fiona Bruce [00:15:54] And Liz, obviously you’ll want to respond to what Vaughan has said, but also just looking at John and Tessa’s questions, they’re in sense two sides of the same coin, you know, should we be taking statues down, remove portraits commemorating people who had profited from slavery, or profited from The Empire, Tessa’s saying, or is that in a sense counter-productive, in terms of looking at the bigger issue?Liz Saville-Roberts [00:16:15] I think certainly this is a time where, I look back to the time when I was raised in Eltham and the terrible appalling murder of Stephen Lawrence, and at that time it drove many establishment changes, but it evidently did not drive enough, we know that. We know that we live in a racist society.
