[0:03:52] It bothers me because America has been too loud and too involved in too many things that it should leave to the UK and Europe. We had a president for 4 years. I mentioned to you that I was lucky enough to see Mr Trump just before he left office and I walked up to him and I asked him, "What does the J in Donald J Trump stand for?" You know what he told me? Genius. The US needs to remain quieter and let the UK and the EU sort it out.

[0:04:32] Do you think Joe Biden should play a role in that?

Frank Luntz
[0:04:36] He should play a role in compromise and common sense, those are the roles that America should be doing going forward, but they should not be dictating policy. They need to speak less and listen more.

Fiona Bruce
[0:04:48] I know you're resident in the UK for many years. Show the audience your shoes that you put on this evening. You can just stick them out the side.

Frank Luntz
[0:04:56] I actually took it off.

Fiona Bruce
[0:04:58] This is Frank making the point here. This is a British story. I love the UK or who is my favourite rock band, it is one or the or the other, but for Roger Daltrey, here you go.
