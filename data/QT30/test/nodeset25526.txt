ANDY UNKNOWN [00:43:04] Transport is key. How will we ensure that this January importation of vaccine doesn’t have an impact on Covid by the two playing against each other with swaying priorities. FIONA BRUCE [00:43:26] This is something that came up before a lot of members of the audience. DAVID LAMMY [00:43:32] We were told by Boris we would have a deal. We have no deal. We have Boris putting the Good Friday Agreement on the table which jeopardises that deal. We have the chief executive of the Port of Dover saying that a no-deal Brexit could cost us, I think it was a billion a week, and that traffic flows could be down by 40 to 60 percent. The clock is ticking, we’re running out of time, and it is now looking worrying that we’ll have no deal with the European Union. We’ll have no deal, by the way, with the United States of America because we would have risked the Good Friday Agreement by having that no deal. It is desperately important that we get a deal, that it is frictionless trade, that it doesn’t involve tariffs, that we have food safety, health and safety, that we haven’t got queues and lorries backed up and I expect a lot of people in an area like Dover are really worried because a lot of promises were being made. We wait to see what will happen. But we know we now have days -- days -- to deliver this against the backdrop -- just remember, a lot of people were saying look, this is tough. We have all European countries dealing with this pandemic. We have all European countries deal with the economic consequences. Let’s have a little extension while we work this out. No! We’re going to have a deal. We’re going to put the government on the table. It’s a mess, but we need the deal. Over to Matt Hancock.
