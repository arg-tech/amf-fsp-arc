Fiona Bruce [00:30:52] Douglas, hearing what Miriam and Ian have said, in terms of young people's unemployment and the furlough falling off a cliff, do you think Boris Johnson should be doing more? It is not falling off a point. What we have is the furlough scheme -- Fiona Bruce [00:31:10] It is significantly reduced in terms of the money people are going to get. David Ross [00:31:14] It has protected 9.6 million jobs across the United Kingdom, 40 billion of taxpayers money has been invested protecting the jobs. 13.85 billion going to the self employed with 5 million claims. This has been significant and one of the most generous schemes anywhere in the world. Fiona Bruce [00:31:34] You have the mayor of Greater Manchester in open revolt. This is not good for Boris Johnson. He has a fight on his hand.
