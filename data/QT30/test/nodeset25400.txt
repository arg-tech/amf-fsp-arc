[FIONA BRUCE] : Do you think we should lift restrictions on 21 June?
Anthony Costello[0:16:04] No, I don't. We have the Indian variant which is now thought to be 50 to 70 percent more transmissible. Evidence comes out today that you are 2.7 times more likely to end up in hospital with this variant compared to the Kent or Alpha variant. And it has evidence of vaccine escape. If you have had one dose of the vaccine you are only 34 percent protected. If you had two doses, you're only about two-thirds protected. So that means the real figure is only 40 percent of our population has had two doses. That means there are millions and millions of people who could be infected by this virus. Now, many of them will be younger and death rates should be much, much lower but many people could end up in hospital. The NHS could be thrown into another surge. We just don't know. So what do we do? I think at the moment what we have to do is watch the data extremely carefully in the next two to three weeks. I think we must devolve power and resources to local public health teams. We haven't given the money and the contact traces that we need.
