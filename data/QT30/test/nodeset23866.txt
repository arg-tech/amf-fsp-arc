Fiona Bruce[0:37:24] The fact is they want to open.
Robert Jenrick[0:37:26] We're spending billions of pounds getting high streets and town centres up and running as well. We are doing everything we can to support those businesses through a very challenging period. But it would be doing the country a disservice at this stage to rush rather than waiting a little bit longer. There is nothing that we can see that there is going to be a delay. It is literally a question now of 10 days until most of the aspects of the economy will be able to reopen.
Fiona Bruce[0:38:02] At the moment only 40 percent of hospitality venues are able to open. Certainly in England. Thangam, do you support the sticking to 17 May or do you think it looks so favourable now we should open up sooner?
Thangam Debbonaire[0:38:20] I think it is a tragedy for the hospitality industry and the wider creative industry, destinations, that we're in the situation we are in now. I wish the government had been driven by data throughout this crisis. If they had they might have heeded their own commissioned report warning what might happen in the winter without certain measures taking place.
Fiona Bruce[0:38:42] Given that we are where we are, do you think that we should be opening sooner as Hugh would like to see or do you think we should be sticking to 17 May in England?
Thangam Debbonaire[0:38:52] I don't have access to the information, but I think it is better if we had been driven by data. That would have helped the hospitality industry.
