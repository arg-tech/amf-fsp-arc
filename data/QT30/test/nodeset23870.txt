[0:43:42] We can see that the effectiveness of preventing effectiveness in severe disease was better than assumed, and it we can see the transmission of people vaccinated is better than the models assumed. We can see the number of cases has fallen faster than the models assumed, that the number of hospital admissions has fallen. So we had enough data a month ago to see the assumptions behind the models were wrong from the start, from the outset were based on bad data. As soon as the real world data start coming in it proved unequivocally that those assumptions were wrong, yet the government has not changed its position, has not followed data rather than dates. It has been hung up on dates. All the while, since at least 8 April, it has been sitting on a report from SAGE saying that hospitality wasn't even responsible.

[0:44:42] I'm a comedian, I would love to be standing in front of an audience having a wonderful time. As a dual citizen, I'm Australian. They have had 900 deaths in Australian. Just over. They have a population of 26 million. Commensurately, we could have had, say, 3,000 deaths here. Maybe, okay, we are densely populated so maybe 6,000. What have we had, 126,000 deaths, something like that.
