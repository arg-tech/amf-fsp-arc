Gillian Keegan[0:29:00] We've put £0.5 billion into covax. That's the second thing and the third thing is we have said we will work with the G7, this is going be to discussed in the next couple of days to vaccinate everybody in the world by the end of next year which will involve us giving some vaccines and re-routing vaccines et cetera, we know that. They will be working on the plan. That's on top of the £10 billion which is one of the biggest aid spends in the world and of course, we know why we've made that because we've been investing in all these other things which I think personally will be a greater benefit to the international community - right now the greatest benefit to the international community is to get everybody vaccinated. That's where we shifted the priority, but it is important.
Fiona Bruce[0:29:50] When we've got the Commons speaker calling on a vote for MPs on this issue. Do you agree?
Gillian Keegan[0:30:00] I don't know. There was a lot of streamlining aid.
Fiona Bruce[0:30:06] I need to let the rest of the panel in. Lucy.
