Fiona Bruce[0:36:57] Ian, very briefly.Ian Murray[0:36:58] At the centre of this pandemic is the care homes in Scotland. Over half the deaths are in care homes and 46% of all deaths are in care homes in Scotland. We are still not testing care home patients or staff. We can talk about capacity. You have to talk about test delivery. It was simply not happening.John Swinney[0:37:20] Yes, we are doing all that.Ian Murray[0:37:22] Care homes are getting in touch with into where patients and staff are not being tested.Fiona Bruce[0:37:29] Alex, you wanted to come in.Alex Massie[0:37:32] My question is, without the anti-body and people knowing they have already been infected how is this track and test going to work? Am I going to have to self-isolate over and over again? If I could many in contact with someone once, do I self-isolate and take off 14 days and if I come into contact with another person, do I take another 14 days off? People who are self-employed and other people are not going to be able to manage that. This is not going to be possible for people.
