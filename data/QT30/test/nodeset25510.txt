[Alex]: I do think we need to get away from the vaccine nationalism. I completely agree. We all need to be in this together. We should all be working together to get the vaccine out as quickly as we can, ensuring that it’s safe and effective. I think that kind of links with the point we made earlier. That’s why I think Gavin Williams’s comments were very unhelpful. It wasn’t diplomatic. It’s not particularly helpful concerning Brexit negotiations. The world knows British scientists are amongst the best but I really don’t think those comments were helpful. I think we should be clubbing together and doing everything as an international community.

Tom Kerridge [00:21:10] It felt toe curlingly cringy this morning. The words coming out. To turn it into a political point-scoring space race. How the scien has worked together to make this happen has been amazing. Lots of vaccines being announced at pretty much the same time. Clearly the scientists have been working together to create something that solves a world problem. It is something that we should all be so proud of. This morning those comments coming out, it puts you -- it’s that bit where you talk about your child, he’s the best, whatever. I find it quite embarrassing this morning, those comments. It was a little toe-curling.
