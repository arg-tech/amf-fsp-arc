James Cleverly[00:16:13] Well, you’re going to have to wait for the announcement because that would be the right thing to do, I don’t want to steal the thunder of my colleagues from the Department of Education. But the point is that we are evolving the plan as we learn more about the nature of the virus – we’ve got to make sure that the students are safe, the teaching professionals are safe, and so this will mean that we are having to adapt. And that is disconcerting, it’s hugely disconcerting for parents. We completely understand that. But we want to make sure that children don’t miss out on their education – education’s incredibly important. And it’s not just about the syllabus, it’s also about the social interactions. And so we want to make sure that we can really establish training provision in a way that’s safe for the students, for the staff, for the training professionals and, of course, their families.Jed Mercurio[00:17:09] Isn’t it confusing, though, for parents and students alike when there was a plan announced…if I recall, it was that schools would go back on 1st June and Michael Gove said it was safe for them to go back on 1st June. And it was predicated on having, I hate to use the phrase, a world-beating test and trace system – there’s been a failure to achieve that.James Cleverly Well…
