Lisa Nandy[0:50:00] There are two things the government should do very quickly. The first is about intelligence. The government appears to have been relying on intelligence up to now that said that the Taliban were unlikely to advance, and that the Afghan government had the resilience to hold out. That clearly was completely and utterly wrong. We need to get a line of sight on what is happening beyond Kabul, because, at the moment, we don't have any understanding as far as I can work out about what is happening on the ground, and that means working with our partners to share intelligence, and get that line of sight. But the second thing that the government ought to be doing is they ought to be exerting what limited leverage we've got on the Taliban, and this is a painful place to be; this is an unpalatable prospect, and this is a difficult scenario we don't want to be in. Unless we start going after, for example, the financial assets of the Taliban, they've taken over the Afghan government's assets, some of those may be in UK banks. Why aren't we freezing the assets? Why aren't we working with partners to impose sanctions? Unless we start putting leverage on the Taliban in order to put pressure on them not to allow Afghanistan to descend into a haven for terrorists, we will reap the benefits.

Lisa Nandy[0:51:18] Nobody is suggesting the Afghan people -- nobody is suggesting that you should punish the Afghan people.

Nelufar Hedayat[0:51:22] But how else will you help them?

Lisa Nandy[0:51:24] For a regime that has come to power through violent means and displaced the government.

Nelufar Hedayat[0:51:30] Any money going into the country, and the Taliban have barely got ten days of money left.

Lisa Nandy[0:51:36] That is absolutely not what I was suggesting.

Nelufar Hedayat[0:51:38] I understand your statement about not wanting to fund the Taliban.

Lisa Nandy[0:51:42] But we should be getting assistance directly to the Afghan people.

Nelufar Hedayat[0:51:46] How?

Lisa Nandy[0:51:46] The United Nations have a position on the ground.

Nelufar Hedayat[0:51:50] Because the Taliban allow it.

Lisa Nandy[0:51:52] All the children ...
