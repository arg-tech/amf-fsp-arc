[0:28:10] Secondly the Government as far as we understand are not going to be vaccinating children. Vaccinating children in the United States and some other parts of the world are vaccinating children. So Robert says there's things to be worked out. If you are not vaccinating children why would they be able to go abroad with their families on this scenario. There's lots of questions here to get to the bottom of.

[0:28:34] Thank you the decision here is the big issue is about our travel industry, and a big march in London yesterday about this. It's almost become the forgotten industry, and the UK airlines, and our travel industry, it's not just holidays that we are talking about. It's people who need to go away on business again to see their families, and airlines are actually really in the last chance saloon now, our UK airlines, they have borrowed all the money they can now. Once they have borrowed that there's no more money in the pot. Nothing from the Government. You see, the Euro governments have given handouts to Air France, KLM, the Germans have done the same, and the U AE have done the same. They have all bailed-out their national airlines. We are leaving ours out to dry. Along with that, it's not just the airlines, it's the whole travel sector, everything that's linked to it, hundreds of millions of pounds worth of business being lost over the past 18 months, and we are almost at breaking point.
