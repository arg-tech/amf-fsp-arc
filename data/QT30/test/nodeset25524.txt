ROBIN SHATTOCK [00:36:12] I think it is an important point. Jay’s position to say I’m going to wait and see what happens, is probably a common response. I think we need to remember that, actually, vaccines, next to clean water, have been the single most effective public health implementation globally. They save saved more lives than any other medicines. People are concerned about this vaccine because they perceive it has been done too quickly. We have done a disservice by saying it takes ten years to make a vaccine. Technology is changing very, very quickly. What has happened is that the same number of participants have been exposed to this vaccine, this particular vaccine, 43,000 participants. When you’re looking at side effects, most side effects occur very quickly,within a week or so of having the vaccine. We would see any severe side effect at this stage. And no regulatory authority, whether it is the UK be medicines regulatory authority or the European Regulatory Authority or the FDA will let anything go through that doesn’t have a totally squeaky clean safety record. [DONE]Now, one thing that I think people completely forget is that a vaccine stimulates your immune system, it tricks it to see if it has seen the virus. So you are getting an aspect of a viral infection that’s so much minor than the real virus. So when you think about the risk benefit, the risk of having a severe outcome from Covid-19 far outweighs any theoretical risk of a vaccine. The problem is vaccines are so successful that diseases go away and all you see is the side effects. Pull out any -- par cell Mo approximately, you probably all had it. Look at the potential side effects of paracetamol. If you never taken it before it would probably scare you to take it but you don’t have the same scare because you are familiar with it. I think the way we’ll build confidence is when we roll it out to vulnerable populations, who are desperate for a vaccine to get their lives back to some sort of normality and we see it protecting lives, see it being safe. I’m sure people like Jay will see the evidence speaks for itself
