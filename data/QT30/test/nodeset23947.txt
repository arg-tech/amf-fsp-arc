[0:23:20] The idea is I think a very sensible one, if you have had a double jab, it does mean the requirement to quarantine I think can be relaxed. There are other issues of course, families, children, who haven't had the jab, and indeed, part of the plan will be to work out a system whereby children can be tested so they can travel with their parents and loved-ones.

Fiona Bruce
[0:23:42] What about people like Kate and others in our audience who wouldn't be double-jabbed?

Robert Buckland
[0:23:46] Exactly there will be of course, contingency made and provision made for people who can't be jabbed for various good medical reasons.

Fiona Bruce
[0:23:56] Or just if they are not old enough?

Robert Buckland
[0:23:58] Look, I think that um... the reality is and in fact Kate said in the answer to the previous question, the evidence grows all the time in favour of the break between people who have been double-jabbed, and the vulnerability to the virus. Clearly, as we get more and more of our population into that double jab position, then it does become I think much easier and freer for us to do the things we want to do.
