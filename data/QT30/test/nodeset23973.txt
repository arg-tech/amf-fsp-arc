[0:54:50] There's a real issue around social justice and poverty, that needs to be part of the food strategy as well. I think we need to be um... moving to healthier food, but enabling people to afford that diet, and that means changing access to food, and an overall food strategy.

[0:55:04] I agree with it. It's something I have long been campaigning for, we face an obesity crisis in the country. Obesity causes cancer, it causes all kinds of very serious debilitating chronic health conditions, it costs the NHS and society billions as well. Although this isn't the only answer to solving the obesity crisis, we should be taking advantage of every potential tool in our locker. We ban other types of advertising, the state intervenes around advertising for things like cigarettes and so on. I think it's entirely sensible.
