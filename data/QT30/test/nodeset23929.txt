Jonathan Ashworth[0:01:34] I cannot see how it can be possibly justified that EUFA VIPs, sponsors, and so on can get round these quarantine rules and go and watch the final at Wembley. Fans should be able to watch the final at Wembley, and we should have and there will be no doubt a testing regime in place. I was lucky to watch Leicester City win at the Cup final. You had to mention that. Yes I was the Leicester MP. We had to be tested and we had to be tested before we went, and then we had to be tested after the event and we had to show our test results to get in.
