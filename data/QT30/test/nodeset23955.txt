Fiona Bruce[0:32:46] Caroline as far as the Green Party is concerned, and irrespective of the data you want people to fly less? This is good news?
Caroline Lucas[0:32:56] We wouldn't want it imposed in this way obviously. I just want to say when it comes to the travel industry, I have a lot of sympathy with what Gary I think was saying we need to be supporting the tourist industry, the travel industry, we need to be supporting them with extended furlough, we need to be making sure the business rates and all of those things are extended as well. It's quite extraordinary the Government extended the restrictions without extending the support to businesses that's not a reason to open up. You are right the Greens do not want people to be flying as much as they do and want to do it in a fair way.
Fiona Bruce[0:33:30] In terms of what some people have said, Jo and others and Donna saying, you know people, at the moment, people who can afford to go and pay for the tests and creating a two-tier system. Your manifesto talked about imposing a levy on anyone who took more than one flight a year, isn't that creating a two-tier system.
