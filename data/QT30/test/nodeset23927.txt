[0:55:46] I agree with what Frank and Yanis said and the audience members said. If it is what people want to do to show their support for each other, it is absolutely right. Words like racism stick. I think the people who are booing, I don't think the vast majority of them are racist. I think they are bored with politics getting in the way of sport. So I don't think we can call them racist, but I do think that the individual racist, people who do have to be called out and something has to be done about that. [DO NE]

[0:56:22] Would you like to see taking the knee stop at the beginning of football games?

AudienceMember 20210805QT34
[0:56:26] No. Again, if it is what the players want to do to support each other, then that's absolutely fine. It is their right to do it.
