Fiona Bruce[0:29:38] Donna?
AudienceMember 20210722QT17[0:29:40] Thank you. I agree with some of the panel there when we were talking about the two-tier system. I feel very uncomfortable about people not being able to afford testing where there's one rule for the rich, whether you are a footballer or EUFA or a rich family bringing your kids to your holiday home because you are allowed to go or you are allowed to go to work in one of these countries. I really feel that far from the Conservatives Government levelling-up, they are creating a two-tier system completely and utterly. It's very much a case of the "haves" and the have-nots.
Fiona Bruce[0:30:22] Are you persuade by the idea the Government is suggesting if you have two jabs, at some point, we don't know yet, that you will be able to go on holiday to amber list countries and without quarantining?
AudienceMember 20210722QT18[0:30:34] As long as the data suggests it's safe. I know Israel today have decided they are going to vaccinate their over 12s you know, but having the vaccine, you know, stops the spread, but I'm not sure, does the vaccine stop you spreading, I don't think it does.
Caroline Lucas[0:30:50] It doesn't.
Fiona Bruce[0:30:50] It doesn't.
Jonathan Ashworth[0:30:52] Masks. And
Victor Adebowale[0:30:56] Look, you know, 3% of all infections end up in hospital. Right. I might sound like a low -- it might sound like a low number in percentage terms but it's a lot of people which is why we have 90% occupancy. I don't think it's an intended consequence but it is an unintended experience of the Government's decision.
