Munira Wilson[00:14:10] No, we’ve put forward a plan, which includes things like identifying safe spaces that could then…having a safe space register that would open up safe community spaces that could potentially be used as additional space for schooling, so that you can then get the kids back to school safely. I mean, my concern is, first of all, the test and trace system clearly isn’t up and running properly. And for any part of lockdown, whether that’s schools or other…or parts of the economy to be opened up, we need to be testing, tracing and isolating every single case to keep people safe.The other thing is just the lack of plan, as Jed was saying. I would’ve hoped that there would’ve been a plan put forward with a range of scenarios perhaps. And certainly, I was talking to head teachers in my constituency on Wednesday and they said to me, we urgently need a plan so that we can start to prepare for September so that we know what we’re doing, but we need that now.
Fiona Bruce[00:15:16] Well, let’s see if we can find out what the plan is, we’ve got James here.
