Steve Barclay[0:20:58] Moving forward, you are right, you go from the protect phase onto the next phase which is how do we we restart the economy? What are the jobs we can move to from those areas of the economy where jobs are being lost, so greening the economy, looking at the challenges, the safer by 2050.
Fiona Bruce[0:21:18] Just very specifically, what about, Boris Johnson has said apprenticeships for young people. When might that be?
Steve Barclay[0:21:26] So the Chancellor will give a statement in July which will be all about the next phase, talking about how we green the economy, how we respond with the infrastructure projects, because jobs, and jobs particularly for young people, is one of the key challenges before us, and that's very much what we are focussed on within the Treasury at the moment.
