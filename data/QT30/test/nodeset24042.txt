Tim Stanley[0:34:50] Just because a -- because it's target isn't ambitious or it is a long way off. It does matter, of course, it would be better if it were sooner, but because they set the target they are going to develop towards it. We run into two problems. One is that the developing world is not going to wish to give up growth that the developed world has enjoyed. So we have to find some way of handling that. An example is the disappointing statement by Indonesia on deforestation, where it said it would be unfair to expect us to keep to these limits. When rich countries have developed so fast, why should they limit themselves? So it may be the West has to spend more money to assist those countries to go to net zero. The second problem we come up against is internal. It is to do the cost of us at home of going green. It was notable that Joe Biden is trying to persuade OPEC to increase production of oil. That's not a good look. There is currently a gulf, a gap between our ambition of where we want to be in Britain and where the technology is. It's not there yet. It has not been developed, it is not quite cheap enough. How do we meet that gap between our ambition and where the technology is?
