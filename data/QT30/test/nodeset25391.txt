Robert Jenrick[0:46:42] We managed to achieve it so far thanks to the success of the vaccine programme. 35 million have had their first jab but there are 18 million adults in the country that -- that's going to take more weeks. We need to show a degree of patience, be cautious, and get through the remaining stages.

Deborah Frances-White[0:47:04] Why do you think Australia has had 900 deaths?

Robert Jenrick[0:47:10] There are many different reasons why countries have responded differently. Now isn't the right time for us to make comparisons. They have not been good comparisons in the past.

Robert Jenrick[0:47:22] Once we are through the pandemic. If your point is let's hold an inquiry, let's do that once we are through this. The government is focused on the vaccine programme, recovery post-pandemic, sustaining people's jobs. Tackling the backlog in the Health Service and public service.

John Bercow[0:48:12] Robert, the reality of the matter is that the government have stopped and started, gone hither and I do not know, broken its promises, misled people, it has been a catalogue of ineptitude on an industrial scale therefore I can well understand, Robert, why you are fighting shy of a full public inquiry. But a full public inquiry there should be. A full public inquiry there will be and when that full public inquiry takes place, we will see an unsparing spotlight on just how much has been done so badly over such a short period.
