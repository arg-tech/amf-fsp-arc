Fiona Bruce [00:06:12] Michelle.Michelle O’Neill[00:06:16]: I would remind viewers that the majority of people and elected representatives in the north are opposed to Brexit. We can see the outworking of that and certainly from my assessment it is very clear that what we’re witnessing is a trade adjustment shock. It is clear that the British government didn’t prepare or work with businesses in terms of them being ready. I think that’s a big thing in terms of operational readiness being able to trade.[DONE] Obviously the deal went right down to the wire so there wasn’t time for businesses to prepare. When you look at what we are experiencing, it is a direct result of Brexit. I think it is nonsensical for some claims which I heard, particularly from Brandon where he said this is a direct result of COVID, when we all know it is because of the fact that there’s not a readiness on the British end in terms of being able to adjust to the new trading appearance. Now there has been some solutions found to a number of issues over the course of the last number of weeks, something I very much welcome. There have been tariffs on steel been imported into the north, obviously there’s a big manufacturing industry here that depends on that. So I’m glad to see some solutions, but clearly this is the outworking of Brexit and we’re going to see a lot more of that. My job as a political leader will be to uphold the protocol and ensure it is implemented in its entirety and to find answers to problems.[DONE]
