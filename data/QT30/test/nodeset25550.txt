Steve Parish[00:38:14] Well, I think that our institutions…I feel, you know, we talk about the government all the time letting us down but, you know, Public Health England made that decision. In Germany, they devolved it very quickly into the local authorities. And I would also say, I mean, we can’t have the whole of the United Kingdom hanging on an app developer developing an app. You know, test and trace is possible to do manually. Most of it, Jed, as you said, will happen manually, even with the app. The app is 15minutes in proximity of two metres to somebody.Jed Mercurio[00:38:41] Yeah, it’s just an adjunct, but you’ve got to have the whole infrastructure.Steve Parish[00:38:44] You can remember if you were with somebody for 15 minutes.Jed Mercurio[00:38:46] Yeah.Steve Parish[00:38:46] So, you know, we need to get test and trace rolled out manually and if the app comes along and helps us do it then great, but we can’t wait for that.
