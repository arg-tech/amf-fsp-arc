Fiona Bruce[0:01:50] David.David Lammy[0:01:51] It's brutally unfair, it's cruel, it's mean, it's nasty. If you're a carer and thank God for our carers in the last 18 months, or you're a nurse or you work in a prison and you've kept COVID from breaking out right across the prison, you're on 18 thousand pounds a year, that cut means 1100 a year that you now have to pay. It's actually the cost of the average energy bill, so this is a huge cost to my constituents and many millions of people across the country, and it's a choice, and it's coming alongside an increase of course in national insurance. Economists are predicting an inflation rise, and certainly interest rates going up by next February, so this is mean, it's nasty, it's unnecessary and there should have been a U turn.
