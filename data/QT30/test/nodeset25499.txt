James[00:47:18]: Brandon it was last week you refused outline, the criteria that needs to be met for a border poll. Can you explain what evidence brought you to that conclusion?
Fiona Bruce[00:47:30] Philip?

Philip[00:47:34]: I would like to ask the Secretary of State why he is not advocating and actually giving us examples of what the British government will do to promote the union. From my perspective as a unionist, I would be concerned that we are sleep walking into conversation. It is a conversation that I honestly never thought would needed to be had in my lifetime and I’m pretty sure it now will be. I would also say to our first minister it is probably due to an incoherence within Unionism at leadership level and what does she see she can do to perhaps improve that.

Louise Haigh[00:48:16] Louise, H I think it is important to set the context for this question and what the last five years have done to the debate Northern Ireland. Because there’s no point denying it has not been a difficult and precarious time for Northern Ireland and I would say for Unionism. Huge debates about the future of Northern Ireland have been had in Westminster and I think a lot of people in Northern Ireland would feel that they are treated as an afterthought in Westminster at times and, at worst, a political football.
