Liz Saville-Roberts [00:16:15] Now there’s one thing that I just could refer back to, what Vaughan said, and this is a little bit disappointing, because frankly Vaughan, I think we are trying to fight from the same corner here, and you do know that Plaid Cymru of course, Adam Price has called for an enquiry into structural racism in Wales, it was in response to his questioning that the first minister of Wales responded with supporting the concept of a black and minority ethnic museum in Wales, and also it’s been Plaid Cymru who’s been leading on perhaps the major point, which is changes to the curriculum.Fiona Bruce [00:17:12] But what Vaughan’s referring to is obviously, Adam Price apologised for comparing Wales to a kind of colonial outpost?
Liz Saville-Roberts [00:17:19] Yeah, when we’re looking at the real big issues of politics one of the rather petty things that we do in politics in the United Kingdom is bring it down to personalities, and these are big, serious…
Vaughan Gething[00:17:29] There’s nothing petty, it matters.Liz Saville-Robert: [00:17:31]…questions. Now, looking at the statues, and I raised this yesterday with the Prime Minister, of course, what we have within the United Kingdom is the way of presenting history very much through the eyes of the Conservatives. And the Prime Minister, when I asked him on this question, is that Conservatives don’t pull down statues, Conservatives don’t pull down statues. It was the imagery of the past. And I know that the Lord Chancellor will agree with this, we have much legislation in place to deal with racial hatred, but we know that we still live within a racial society, which acts upon racialism and racism.
