Vaughan Gething [00:42:50] And so it does show we’ve got an effective system here, we’ve delivered that in partnership between our National Health Service and the [authorities that deliver the system 00:43:33]. 
So, I think the question really describes the position in England, in Wales our start has been much more effective than that, and the challenge is how we continue to do that, as we progressively unlock more activity when it’s safe to do so. So, here in Wales, I think we have a good story to tell about our start to contact tracing, and I’m very proud of the work that our public services are doing to deliver that service to help keep Wales safe.
Fiona Bruce [00:43:58] Do you agree with that Liz?
Liz Saville-Roberts [00:44:00] Well, we know the fiasco that happened with the testing targets from Wales, where they had to be given up on. We actually had to give up on targets because they were so impossible to reach. And I would go back to the question of the Roche testing contract, when we know that thousands of tests were taken away from Wales, by the UK government, and for some reason or other, I think the people of Wales deserve to hear the full story of this, and yet I understand Vaughan, that you’re not releasing the actual email correspondence, which was the reason as to why we don’t have these tests in Wales.
