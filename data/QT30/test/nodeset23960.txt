Victor Adebowale[0:39:30] I think the situation is shocking. It's truly shocking as a father of girls, I just think it's unacceptable. What I do think, and I just thought it was a good thing that you actually showed some contrition and it's rare these days, you know some shame, and some responsibility. But let's be clear, there are a number of problems in the system. You have mentioned a couple of them. Resources are a couple of them. There's a relation between the resources we put in the system and the efficacy. When you cut the budget by 50% you are talking half the water out of the bucket and expecting them to put out a bigger fire, it's not going to work. We do need to look at the resources. There's a bigger issue here. I recall a question time a few weeks ago I was on we were talking about women's safety in public. I said then, we need to educate men. We need to create a strategy for public spaces that are safe for women. We need to ensure that women feel safe in public, and in private.
