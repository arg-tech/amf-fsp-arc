Kate Andrews[0:16:28] Freedom day was delayed, many of us are still not able to live the lives we would like to live. We are pretending to the world that we are back to normal with these mass events, it's one of the reasons that they are getting status, and they are allowed to go ahead. We know something different is happening and my concern is that the Government is becoming complacent. They are buying-into that projection, they are buying into the idea that's what Britain looks like, but we know on a day-to-day basis unfortunately for many people it doesn't.
Victor Adebowale[0:16:58] It's important like half of what you said there I absolutely agree with but I happen to face the people on the frontline doing the work. The fact of the matter is when I say 95% of occupancy is true, they are worried we might have 1500 people now with Covid in hospital but it is increasing. If I may, and it's increasing! On top of that they have to cope with the demand that's been delayed. So, you know I agree with you on the sight of this, it looks bad, it is challenging but we have to acknowledge the pressures are real in the NHS. They are not making this up. It's not a fantasy, they are real. And we have to be cautious.
