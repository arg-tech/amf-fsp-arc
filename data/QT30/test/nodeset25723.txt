Jon Ashworth[0:00:40] I totally agree with Alex. It is a scandal! The reason why these questions are continuing to circulate is because Boris Johnson has failed to provide a full and Frank explanation as to who paid for the lavish upgrade of his Downing Street flat.Fiona Bruce[0:00:56] Of course he says that he has paid for it. The question is who paid for it initially?Jon Ashworth[0:01:04] Indeed, indeed. This matters. It matters I believe for two reasons. First it matters in its own right, because we as politicians should be held to higher standards, and we should stand for principles of honesty, and integrity, and it's not good enough to say, oh this is just typical Boris Johnson, we know he lies, we know he plays fast and loose, it's just the way he is. That isn't good enough.
