Fiona Bruce[0:13:02] Daniel.Daniel[0:13:04] I wanted to make a comment about the lockdown. So I live with -- both my parents are in that vulnerable high risk category so I have been in lockdown for over four months now, because instead of following what the Government advice was I decided that it was probably safer for us to lockdown earlier, because if you look at when we locked down compared with every other country in Europe, including Germany, we came out later. So I just want to ask the Government if they think that the advice has either been clear or sensible? Because, the number of people I know that have died from the virus, it's over ten now. So... I don't feel like I have been able to put my full faith in the Government in looking after my parents.
