Fiona Bruce[0:54:46] John, I need to let you answer this question. Is there any way that the kind of German model could be seen here, where the fans are the majority shareholders in the club?John Bercow[0:54:56] Yes, it could be. I'm glad you are familiar with the German model. It is a commendable one. I look forward to what the review finds. I agree with Robert, she is a seriously minded and independently-focused person. Frankly, I think that the very principle of competitive sport was brutally violated by these big billionaires meeting in solemn and conspiratorial conclave and plotting the takeover of the sport on the basis you pay your admin fee, you get admitted and never get removed.
