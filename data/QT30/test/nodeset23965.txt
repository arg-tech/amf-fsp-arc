Fiona Bruce[0:45:44] I hear what you say but I'm not sure you are right the only difference is they don't report it. There's no doubt domestic violence happens to men, and rape, but it happens a lot more to women that's the case. That's not to says that your concern is not legit. Robert?
Robert Buckland[0:46:02] Rape can only be as a matter of law permitted by men but the stigma for men in coming forward, and talking about it is huge! So we get what you are saying absolutely. And listening to you loud and clear, it is part of the strategy as well. We want more men to come forward and feel confident they are going to be supported through a very difficult and traumatic experience.
Fiona Bruce[0:46:20] Caroline?
Caroline Lucas[0:46:28] Well. I think that Robert's apology was very welcome and alongside an apology there has to be accountability and as we have been hearing rape has been decriminalised that's what it feels like I think to so many men and women right now who are trying to report rapes. And I really worry that on the one hand you have got the absolutely starving of resources that have gone into the court case and the CPS and the police, and you know police have lost around 20, 000 officers, so it's not surprising that there's less -- fewer police there to follow those cases up. But it's also the case as Kristina pointed out that you know, the current system puts the survivors on trial. They themselves on trial when they report a rape.
