Caroline Lucas[0:48:20] What we need is more action, more funding, when Robert first talked about the failings of the system, he didn't even mention the cuts to funding. That has to be in there. But we also need to have some more ambition and urgency. This review has been two years in the action. We need action now. Not waiting another two years so we have more rules so people don't have to hand over their phones for months and years on end. It should happen now!
Jonathan Ashworth[0:48:48] I agree with Colette, and Hannah, and others who have made and contributed. I mean, I did think Boris Johnson's remarks yesterday were offensive and lacking in judgment. You are right Victor, he would have had it in his script. He would have, before he went into the chamber, he would have been throwing around lines with his advisers, and said that's a great line Prime Minister, and definitely use that in the Commons, he would have been determined to get it out regardless of what question he was asked. I think he should have paused and thought carefully before using that line. It did rather demean him. You can't imagine a Margaret Thatcher or a Tony Blair using a line like that in the House of Commons to be frank about an issue of this sensitivity.
