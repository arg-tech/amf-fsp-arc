Fiona Bruce[0:02:10] Isn't the point the final might not happen here if the dignitaries are not allowed in?Jonathan Ashworth[0:02:16] We have to negotiate with EUFA on that, we cannot be held to ransom. We know this virus sadly remains extremely dangerous. Now, I'm fed up of these sodding restrictions! Am I allowed to say sodding? You are. I'm fed up of these restrictions. Sick of them. I'm also aware that since the first of May, we have had 260,000 confirmed cases of this virus. In the last week, 80, 000. In the coming weeks, because of the way it grows, we are going to see more of this virus grow amongst the unvaccinated. It spreads like wild fire amongst the unvaccinated, Matt Hancock's words.
