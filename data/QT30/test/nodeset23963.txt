AudienceMember 20210722QT25[0:42:54] If somebody has been raped, the last thing she wants to do is to have to not only go through all the terrible trauma of having to tell other people about it, have a phone conversation, have her entire private life investigated for anything at all that the defence can use to say, well, you know, she's encouraged this, it's her fault in some way or other. But if, I mean, I'm sure if I was in the position where I knew that I was going to -- it was going to be made public, and it will be, and this person was going to be walking around waiting for a court case to come up maybe a year, two years later, do I really want my mental health to suffer for that length of time, that hanging over me? I think there must be so many women who don't even report it because they cannot face what they will have to go through, that's the problem.
Fiona Bruce[0:43:56] Over half of rape victims withdrew from the investigations last year, I mean, they did report it then they pulled out of it. Of course we don't know how many don't report it.
AudienceMember 20210722QT26[0:44:06] I hear all the panel about the women, what about men? What about gay men? I'm a gay man, we all get raped. It's not just about women.
