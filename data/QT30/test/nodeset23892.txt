AudienceMember 20210805QT06[0:10:44] We're renowned for being a bit petty. They came up with a rule that you couldn't sell a banana because it was the wrong shape.
Fiona Bruce[0:10:54] Well, there is some conjecture, I don't think that's actually true, but it was written up a lot in the papers at the time, but as it turned out, it was not true.
Lucy Powell[0:11:06] Another bit of fake news.

AudienceMember 20210805QT07[0:11:16] It is a nonsense. Nobody is suggesting for a minute that the chilled meats coming from the mainland to Northern Ireland are in any way unsafe. Come on, EU, accept the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and let's get round the table and sort it out. I mean, the people in Southern Ireland must be appalled because it must have an impact on their free movement as well and free trade. These things can all be sorted out if there is a willingness on both parties to get together and address it with some common sense and move on.

Gillian Keegan[0:11:58] We have been there before.
Fiona Bruce[0:12:00] The UK is threatening to unilaterally increase the grace period...
Gillian Keegan[0:12:06] We have been there before.
