Fiona Bruce[0:34:16] Tony.
AudienceMember 20210805QT17[0:34:16] Fiona, thank you, and panel. We should stop beating ourselves up. When we look at the developed nations, and one of the panellists got it wrong, I don't think it is GDP, I think it is a percentage of gross net income.
Fiona Bruce[0:34:30] Of national income, yes.
AudienceMember 20210805QT18[0:34:34] So let's get the facts straight. Don't beat ourselves up. We have been one of the biggest contributors. I think we're in the top five and we bring it down to 0.5%. The majority of developed countries, something like 40 countries, are nowhere near 0.5%, and those countries include USA, Japan, France, Greece, and many, many others who don't come near 0.5%, and we're going to bring our target down to 0.5%, if we add our vaccination programme to the world, it is possible our contribution will go up way above 0.7%. So, I don't think we should beat ourselves up. I think we should check the facts. See what we're doing, add the numbers together and find that we're still a very big contributor to the rest of the world with overseas aid either in monetary terms or in more practical terms.
