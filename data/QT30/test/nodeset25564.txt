Jess Phillips[0:31:08] Now is the time to step up. Like, Germany has already announced stimulus packages, and say: What are we going to do to create jobs and training and encourage businesses to take these people on? Because these are our children.

Iona Bain[0:31:26] Sorry, if I could just say, yes, I would say that Jess is absolutely right to say that colleges that help 16 to 19 year olds should be included in the Covid catchup fund. And that actually, spending that little bit more time in education could make all the difference. So, if we had targeted funding for booster courses, that just allowed young people to build up their skills, both hard and soft, before they go into the labour market, that could make all the difference between them being employable and attractive worker and being on the job scrap-heap. But I also think that this issue is too important to descend into party politics, and we have been hearing a long time about need for a commission on social care because, understandably, that's going to be extremely important to address after this crisis, but I wonder whether we also need a commission on young people's opportunities and jobs, for the parties to work together and to agree that this should be a priority and debate the details by all means, but for us to try and transcend that party politics and come together.
