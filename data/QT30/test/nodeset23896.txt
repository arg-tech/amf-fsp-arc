Lucy Powell[0:16:32] What I want to know about 21st June, we would like it to happen. I always thought that the whole idea of a big freedom day, of a massive unlocking was a misnomer and has raised expectations in the wrong way, but what is the Plan B if that is not going to be the case? I've not heard anything about that. I don't know what economic support is going for businesses that would still have to close. I don't know what we're going to be doing about the rising infections. In Greater Manchester that's having a massive impact on young people at school. There is a huge disruption now because it is racing through secondary schools and colleges. Businesses are having to close because increasingly staff are getting pinged by the app and have to stay at home for 10 days and so on and making business unviable. So, in the event that we do unlock, what's the plan? The case that we don't unlock, what's the Plan B and what would be the terms under which further restrictions would ease later on?
