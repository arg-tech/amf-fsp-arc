AudienceMember 20210708QT09[0:24:02] The only way we can go now is forward. We cannot go back. We cannot go into another lockdown situation. We must come out of this. Of course, we come out of it gradually and that's the right way to go. But, you know, if we look at the pictures we've all seen of people looking at the football -- I hate to go back to the football all the time -- the seating outside was socially distanced for a reason. When you see the pictures of everybody watching the match, everybody is up on their feet, everybody is hugging. Yes, we have to go forward but we still must be careful. There may be less people in hospital with COVID these days, however, there are still people suffering from long COVID, which is a really serious illness. We don't know the impact of people's bodies that has taken yet. So we still have to be very careful when we're coming out of this and we all have to work together to make sure the only direction we go is forward.

AudienceMember 20210708QT10[0:25:02] I just really hope the new normal in education goes back to schools being back to normal. We're seeing another surge of lots of children isolating at the moment. I hope -- and that's a real priority for the government, to get our children back to school as much as they can, as difficult as it is as we cope with the pandemic. Our young children have this legacy to deal with. I hope we can get the schools to as normal as possible in September.
