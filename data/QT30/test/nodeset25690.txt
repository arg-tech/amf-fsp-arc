Caroline Lucas[0:56:04] Someone mentioned COVID. If you look at how much the government has spent paying people to be on furlough, that's about 100 billion a year. That has put the economy on ice but it hasn't achieved anything very positive beyond making sure that people could keep going. If we put that money, that kind of money into the transition to a green economy, it would create many, many jobs. It would begin to pay for itself as those jobs raise the taxes that go back to the Treasury. We can do this. I think what is so frustrating, look at some of the countries in Europe who are already working out mass transit, public transport schemes, we should have a vision that isn't looking at petrol cars and thinking how do we replace all of those with electric cars because the building of cars is energy-intensive. We need more manualisation among public transport schemes. The person at the back was saying she would love to use the train but it is more expensive than flying. That is a policy choice the government made. It could make a different choice. It could tax the fuel domestically and make transport more affordable. We know how to do this stuff. What we need to do is a prime minister who isn't giving the green light to a coal mine, isn't planning Â£27 billion on the biggest road ever, but is serious about investing in the economy.
