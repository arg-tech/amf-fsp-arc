AudienceMember 20210722QT14[0:25:32] People who have the funds together able to pay for a quarantine hotel upon their return great, crack on. What about the rest of us that can't? Nine children in a class of 30 are living in poverty, and yet people who can afford to take their children abroad are going to do so. I'm aghast at how the Government thinks this is sensible, is measured, there's members of this panel that can't even work! Yet for people who have money, who are affluent, they are able to go on holiday. Some people here can't even pay their bills. I think the Government needs to take a very long, hard look at the people who they serve, and make some decisions and give some consistent messaging to people that are everyday people on the street. So that's how I feel and I am aghast. You have kids who don't have vaccinations traveling to and from, and the testing is not reliable enough to guarantee they will not be bringing a variant or any other thing into this country. So

Jonathan Ashworth[0:26:46] I would want to understand the clinical evidence upon which it has been made.
