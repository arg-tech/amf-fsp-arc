Victor Adebowale[0:40:32] I think that you know, unless we can take the safety of girls and women seriously, as strategically seriously, this will continue. So, we need the police to have the resources to investigate. We need the Criminal Justice system to have the resources to prosecute. We need the public prosecution officers to have enough resources. More, the thing that really upsets me, is the cases of women that have not been taken seriously, and haven't had the support. It's not -- it is outrageous frankly, that, you have been in Government for a while now, and I'm a crossbencher, I would say it to any political party, it is simply unacceptable that you have women who have been faced with the most shocking appalling crime, and yet they report their mental health, their emal support, their safety is not taken seriously by any section of public services. You have to get that right. You have to get it right for women that are raped. You have to get it right for girls who fear rape. You have to get it right for both who feel unsafe in public and private.
