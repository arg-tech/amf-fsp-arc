[0:49:12] I disagree with Gillian on this. The division has been created by those who don't want to have a conversation about the message and there are still those people and those people every day abuse black football players who find themselves on the end of it, whether it is publicly at matches, or whether it is on social media and elsewhere. Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford, but they feel fed-up that it hasn't made the progress they want and that's why what Gareth Southgate was saying was so important that we can be and we are a patriotic country that upholds traditions but at the same time demanding progress on issues that blight our society. There are people who want to make this a woke issue or divisive issue, whatever...

[0:50:04] Others have talked about statues and all that kind of thing.

Lucy Powell
[0:50:08] I disagree with that profoundly. These are football players who have a platform who got fed-up with the fact that they're on the wrong end of racism, all the time in 2021, and they want to make a stand and it has started a conversation and, yes, of course, it is not actually, you know, making things change necessarily, but it is having that conversation and that's their right to want to keep it on the agenda and I think it is important that it does keep on the agenda.
