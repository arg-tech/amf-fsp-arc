Fiona Bruce[00:45:38] Okay. Dale.
Dale Unknown[00:45:42] I just think we need to start going back to home grown in the UK, our meat and everything that we have that we need for food. That should be our first point of call. Obviously it gets down the air miles, CO2, helps the environment and everything. So let's start looking at growing things and producing things in Great Britain, because we're a great country and we make amazing products, and we can sell them across the world, and citizens across the world want to buy it, so let's start looking at us first.
Fiona Bruce[00:46:17] Charlie.
Charlie Unknown[00:46:19] Yeah, it strikes me this is a bit of a non-issue to be perfectly honest, because, as Martin said, there will be a demand for the Australian meat going to China and the Far East, and, as Richard said, hopefully as UK customers we will chose in the supermarket the food that we want to eat, and hopefully we will chose British, but ultimately it will be our choice. I don't want to have it regulated by anyone about my choice, which is again what Nadhim was saying about the EU commissioners. Let's widen the range of what we can have and let's make more sensible choices ourselves.
