Kate Andrews[0:04:36] Andrew Lloyd Webber did a fantastic thing, he turned down the Government's offer to make his new musical a trial. He was making threats saying he could open at full capacity. They offered him a trial. He turned it down. He knows most of the theatre industry does not have his clout and power to get what they want. It is deeply hypocritical and unfair at the G7 as well that ministers behind the scenes, long lens cameras capturing them, Boris Johnson the leaders of the world, and standing up drinking, not Social Distancing, 
and there really seems to be one rule for people who are in Government, or have access to the Government, and another rule now for everybody else. If it is safe enough for Matt Hancock and Michael Gove to be sitting in VIP at Wembley watching the football, I hope they had a delightful time, it is safe enough for us to watch a few more friends over to watch the football in our home.
