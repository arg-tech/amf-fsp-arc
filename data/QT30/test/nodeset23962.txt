Victor Adebowale[0:41:46] We need to put some money into women's refuges, we need to ensure that women everywhere can pick up a phone and get the support they need. I'm involved in services to women's refuges. It's just not good enough. So, yes, we take the apology, let's have the resources, let's have the plan, let's have women in charge of that plan, so they feel safe. So we don't have this conversation again.

AudienceMember 20210722QT23[0:42:16] Thank you. The Government has announced a new crime bill and included tougher sentencing for rape, convictions, but it's pointless if the convictions are so low. It's a deterrent but there's no deterrent there if it's a 2, 3, 4% of cases, it doesn't matter, it doesn't work. More needs to be done about prevention rather than cure.
Victor Adebowale[0:42:42] Absolutely.
Fiona Bruce[0:42:44] Kristina?
AudienceMember 20210722QT24[0:42:46] I think one of the things that we are missing completely is how long it takes for a rape case for actually come to court.
