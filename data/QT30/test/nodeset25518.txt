Yeah, thank you, Fiona. I want to get back to my question, Nadhim. Did your government fail by not closing the borders? On 9 April the cases in India were at 90,000 a day. It was reported all over the media, and, quite frankly, you didn't have to be a minister or a virologist to actually work out there's a problem here. I do believe that our government have done one thingâ€¦ I feel like I'm in a groundhog day. Why do we have Brazilian, South African, Indian variants in our country? And if you remember to our COVID special back on 6 January we talked about playing the hokey-cokey. Our government [inaudible 0:18:09] you don't know if you're coming or going or which way you're going to go round next. But one thing is clear, how many lives is this going to cost? You're doing testing all over the country, there's cases in 117 areas of the country now, and, quite frankly, what are you learning? What is your plan? You seem to be shooting from the hip and have absolutely no direction. I don't trust you.
