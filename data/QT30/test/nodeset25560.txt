Fiona Bruce[0:18:00] Let's take another question now from Imran Anwoir.
Imran Anwoir[0:18:08] Hi. With youth unemployment on the rise and the worries over further negative impacts on our economy and recovery and as a recent graduate as of December 2019, what assurances do I have as a young person entering the professional world of work that there will be enough opportunity available for me?
Fiona Bruce[0:18:28] What's your situation, Imran?
Imran Anwoir[0:18:32] So, I had a job offer in the industry, which I was -- which is what I graduated in, but it was revoked because of lockdown. And, you know, they said that because of their financials for the rest of the year and the worry around Coronavirus, they weren't really sure if they could keep my new employment. So, I'm just a little bit concerned about if there is enough, you know -- young people already don't have enough opportunity as it is in the professional space, so, I'm just worried about what plan the Government has to sort of bring that opportunity up first.
