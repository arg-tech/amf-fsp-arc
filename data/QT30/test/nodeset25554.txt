Unknown Speaker[0:01:16] I welcome the easing of lockdown so people can move on with their lives. Lives is all about risks and we've been under the complete control of the State since March 21st, is it not time to allow people who are aware of the risks now to make decisions about how they want to approach this situation. Given we live in a free, liberal society?Fiona Bruce[0:01:38] Theo.Theo Paphitis[0:01:46] I think they were trying to keep us safe. I don't think any one of us wants to be kept locked up but the reality is if we hadn't had the lockdown, many of us.wouldn't be here today, especially oldies like me. I think we have had to endure that, and we have to come out of this sooner rather than later, I totally agree because otherwise we are going to have a lot of unintended consequences, that's things that will be a lot worse than possibly, you know, some minor out breaks of the actual virus. So. It's important we come out now. It's important that we adopt the new normal, because, it is a new normal.
