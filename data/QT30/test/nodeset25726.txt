[0:46:26] I would hate for anybody, particularly those of you who bravely and rightly stood up for our country and stood alongside Afghans and helped to deliver those gains, to come away with the sense that we are anything other than absolutely proud of those achievements and determined to do everything that we can in these most difficult of circumstances to defend them. There is a generation of young Afghans that grew up with a transformation in what they could expect from their futures. They learned languages, they studied all over the world, they took those skills back to Afghanistan, and put them to good use making a contribution, and they got access to education. Millions of them - girls, who never would have had it before. They're watching the future unravel in front of their eyes. We owe it to them not to engage in a counsel of despair, but to think what can we do right now to assert leverage over the situation and protect those gains.
