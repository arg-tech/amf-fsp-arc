Fiona Bruce[0:06:40] This is not something you saw coming, not according to Lord Frost anyway?
Gillian Keegan[0:06:46] You wouldn't expect there would be a harsh implementation that you wouldn't get things on to the shelves of supermarkets. They are concerned this is a back door into the single market. I understand that they want to keep the single market protected. We are talking about goods going from the EU to Northern Ireland. Get around the table, we haven't got time now. Time is short. Let's get some sensible approaches so we make it easier for these things to be exported and we all want the same thing in terms of the Belfast agreement, the settlement...
Fiona Bruce[0:07:26] Kavita is desperate to come in.
Kavita Oberoi[0:07:34] What surprises me, you say we didn't understand what we were signing...
Gillian Keegan[0:07:42] I didn't say that.
Kavita Oberoi[0:07:44] Lord Frost... In business when we're two parties, we sign agreements and once we signed on the dotted line, that's gospel. Okay, that's gospel. If we didn't understand, we seek legal counsel at the time, and I think what is happening now, obviously the Northern Ireland protocol, I don't know the detail, it overrides the Belfast agreement and that's why we're having these issues and obviously it has to be worked through, but from a business perspective, you have to look at what you're getting into and we've got into that now.
