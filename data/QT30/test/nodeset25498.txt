Fiona Bruce [00:24:00] We hear what you have to say. Thank you very much. I’m going to take another point but Darren, what do you have to say. I think we dealt with the dog now, if you have anything else you want to add. [Darren]: The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, when was the last time he went around a supermarket in Northern Ireland and what did he see? Fiona Bruce [00:24:20] I’m not sure how interesting that is. Unless he went post-January -- Brandon Lewis [00:24:28] Because of restrictions I have not been since Christmas. The point I was going to make after Michelle was pretty much the point that Arlene made. Those clauses we were talk about we were able to remove because the EU when we got the agreement on the petrol removed some of the requests they made which would have breached strand 3 of the Good Friday Agreement. Arlene is absolutely right. Those causes were about. I do take Emma’s point. I would say, and this links into the point I think Thomas might have made, it is important that businesses, and I appreciate small businesses are focused on running their businesses and doing their day-to-day work. One of the things they can do is deal with the Trader Support Service. It is free, the government is paying for that. Some of the companies named tonight who have worked with that have found no problems at all. They respond to 99.7, I think it is, percent of all calls and deal with the issues within 15 minutes. It is a really good service and I would encourage all businesses, particularly small businesses, to do that. The government picks up the cost of that.
