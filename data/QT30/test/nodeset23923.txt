Fiona Bruce[0:50:40] Yanis.
Yanis Varoufakis[0:50:42] I think it is actually brilliant that England players are taking the knee, feel the need to take the knee and that some people boo them, that's also fine. I'm with Frank on this.
Fiona Bruce[0:50:52] Why is that fine then? Yanis, let me ask you, why is that fine? There are plenty of people who think it isn't fine.
Yanis Varoufakis[0:51:00] Probably has traditionally attracted racist, and British National Party people. Of course, this is a small minority, but it is a vocal minority and they can sometimes, they can influence, and in fact good people who are standing next them and joining the booing because they think they are standing up for England. Quite honestly, they think that. I'm all for unity against racism, Gillian, but I'm not in favour of papering over divisions. It is important to have the conversations that we're having and we would not be having it if there was not this kind of division on the pitch.
