[0:50:56] I have to push-back on some of Caroline's comments there. It's hyper bolly to say rape has been decriminalised and it remains one of the most heinous crimes, and I would push-back on the idea of educating the jury. I think that Robert's apology shows the extent to which this isn't a political issue, it's not one in which we use to score points against one another, and attack the other side of the party. I think that every single politician on this panel representing their parties takes rape and sexual assault and domestic violence very, very seriously. There seems to be very broad agreement that more resources need to be committed to help women through this process and the men who are going through this process as well. Also to help actually gather the evidence help the police with their resources, so there hopefully there be more convictions in the future and not by changing the law, changing the system and suggesting it's been decriminalised but by making sure we get the resources to get things over the line. We need to work together on this. I don't think it's one for political point-scoring.
