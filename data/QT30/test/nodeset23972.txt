[0:53:52] Can I just on that point.

Fiona Bruce
[0:53:54] Quickly three or four minutes left!

[0:53:56] To point out that in many of the poor areas that is where you will see the chicken and poor food shops. It is will planning, and what we allow to happen in certain areas just saying.

[0:54:04] Caroline?

Caroline Lucas
[0:54:06] Well I think it is a small step forward, and it's long overdue. I think it needs to apply to all platforms, and I'm deeply concerned about what is being pushed on places like TikTok and other places as well.

Fiona Bruce
[0:54:22] What about the fact you won't be able to advertise you know, a burger from a well-known burger merchant after 9 but you could advertise a ready-meal that has more fat?

Caroline Lucas
[0:54:36] There are anomalies, but I'm glad the Government is beginning to look at it. It needs to be in the context of the overall food strategy, people are right to talk about the fact that in many cases junk food can be cheaper, and fills you up quicker.
