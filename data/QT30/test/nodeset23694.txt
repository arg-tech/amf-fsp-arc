AudienceMember 20210916QT03[0:05:02] I'm interested to know why er... well firstly, um... who made the accusation, and why was it taken so seriously in secondly even if he didn't pay for it straight away, we all buy stuff on buy now pay later, why shouldn't he?
Fiona Bruce[0:05:18] Will?
AudienceMember 20210916QT04[0:05:20] I think for me, this is just the tip of the iceberg at the moment. You know, since Boris has been in power it seems to be scandal after scandal and legality aside whether it's legal or not, it's just the moral issue. I think he just treats the public with disdain. I think he has got to stop.

Danny Sriskandarajah[0:05:42] Look, it's not for me to say whether you know, to pass judgment on this matter but I do know from our experience at Oxfam about how important transparency is, you know, the only way that we have made progress in recent years across the world has been to bring in much higher standards of openness and transparency, and you know, for many people in this country, the hope is that we will come out of this pandemic, you know, this huge shock to our nation, building back fairer because we will create a fairer better society, and an equally important part is to build-back institutions that people can once again trust. I think it's really important, not just on this issue, but a number of other issues we have seen recently that we see politicians go over and above when it comes to transparency.
