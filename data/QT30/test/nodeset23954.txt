[0:31:20] I have to say, if it's a red country you shouldn't be going right, amber? I don't get it. It's like, basically, it's either green or you shouldn't be going. I haven't booked a foreign holiday, and I won't be booking a foreign holiday. I understand the pressures on the travel industry. But as I say, there's no wealth without health. There just isn't. And we have to do what we can to support the travel industry, and the people who work in it. I'm here because I want to protect the NHS, and I want to ensure that it's here, and can work through the pandemic and what happens after it. I just think we should have an abundance of caution. I think it's too early, I know people want to get off. I know that. They want to get off to their holidays, and go to Bermuda, I get it. But we can't afford to take the chance either way! Jonathan is right, the Delta variant spreads really quickly. It spreads really quickly and there's some evidence that there may be some vaccine leakage but we have 40 cases of a Delta plus in this country. We know that we start with 40 then it's 400 then it's 4, 000. I just think we have worked so hard let's just take a break, let's just take a break. Let's not rush this! Let's not rush it. Let's have an abundance of caution.
