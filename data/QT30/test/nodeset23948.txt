Fiona Bruce[0:24:24] But someone like Kate we are in a situation tonight where someone like Kate and others in the audience and at home of course, who won't have their second jab by 19 July, or in the weeks after. At the moment won't be able to go to these countries without quarantine.
Robert Buckland[0:24:40] Let's keep on getting as many second jabs in arms as possible. I accept there might still be people who aren't eligible at that time. I want to take issue with Kate's point that we are trying to create a two-tier society. All we are trying to do is allow people to enjoy the pleasure of a holiday which for most of us, me included, has not been the case for well over a year. It seems sensible to me to follow the evidence about double jabbing, and to now extend it to amber countries.
Fiona Bruce[0:25:10] Sorry Kate, so sorry I need to bring other people in hang on a minute. Jo I can see you are shouting rubbish at your screen! Tell us what you are saying? Other than that obviously.
AudienceMember 20210722QT14[0:25:24] I am aghast at these plans, as for a two-tier system, you couldn't divide the country more than by implementing something like this!
