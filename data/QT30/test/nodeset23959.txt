Fiona Bruce[0:38:10] What did you think of the they jabber we jab?
Robert Buckland[0:38:12] I think at the end of Prime Minister's questions, both the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition like to make a general comment about each other, and each other's party. I do not believe in the Prime Minister's mind that that was linked to the genuine remarks he made, the apology he too made about rape, can I say this Fiona, when he first became Prime Minister and I first became Lord Chancellor, one of the first conversations he had with me was about rape. I said to him one of the big things we can do is increase support for women and victims by scaling-up the number of independent sexual violence advisers, we are doing that now, we are spending this year alone 27 million I want to increase the numbers by hundreds, because the evidence shows that with support, more women and men as well, can carry through their complaints through to proper investigation and prosecution. That is what I want to see happen. That's what I'm going to work towards over the next few years. Victor?
Victor Adebowale[0:39:06] You know what, I do think that the Prime Minister does this illiteration, it was in his scripted. It caused offence. Because it caused offence to women and we are talking about rape, he should apologise, he should apologise because it caused offence.
