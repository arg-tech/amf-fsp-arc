Steve Parish[00:05:13] The vast majority of footballers, you know, come from backgrounds that wouldn’t be considered affluent. And what a lot of people don’t realise is, what an extended network of people they look after and are responsible for, particularly many of the players that come from overseas. So, you know, the picture that’s portrayed of footballers as being, sort of, young men with too much money just really isn’t fair in most of the cases that I come into contact with. And certainly, I’ve been incredibly proud of all of the players that I know and the way they’ve acted through the whole crisis.Fiona Bruce[00:05:49] So, Lisa, the question from Charlie is, what does it tell us about the government’s priorities that it was forced into this decision by Marcus Rashford.Lisa Nandy[00:05:58] Well, I mean, I agree with Jed. I think, I very much welcome the fact that the government did a U-turn on this. And I think the campaign that Marcus Rashford led was really inspirational, but it shouldn’t take a brave young footballer to shame the government into action. The real question is, how could we possibly only 48 hours ago still have been debating whether we were going to allow some children to go starving hungry over the school holidays?
