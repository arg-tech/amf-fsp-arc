[0:08:16] No wonder, you know, the EU, like you said Yanis, are behaving like spoilt brats and we've got contentions over in the UK, but those agreements were signed and those agreements are there now. So I'm going to be interested how we navigate out of this now and I feel sorry for the people in Northern Ireland and the peace there because it will affect peace there. It is bigger than sausage wars.

[0:08:52] Once upon a time our word was our bond. We did it at the last minute, maybe there wasn't enough thinking. What other problems are we going to have from the Brexit agreement? If we sign an agreement we should stick to it. If we haven't done the homework to work out it is a sensible agreement, then we have to work things out. I am afraid this mess is very much about getting Brexit done as quickly as possible without thinking of ramifications.
