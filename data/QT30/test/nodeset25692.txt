[00:39:27] Okay, alright, I'm just going to getâ€¦ Forgive me, sir, I'm going to get round the rest of the panel otherwise it will just be you and the Andrew show. It's on the entertaining side in some ways but I think let's move on. Anas, I want to come to you. So the question is, as COP26 approaches, could you tell us when an independent Scotland would put the economy or environment first when deciding what to do with the domestic oil industry?

[00:39:47] I think the challenge is climate change is a recognised borders. So to turn an issue of global cooperation and the eyes of the world being on Glasgow and the requirement for international leaders to work together, to challenge climate change, to do the very thing that Brian says we need to do, to confront the climate emergency and safe the planet. To reduce that to a conscious debate about Scotland's place in the UK, I think frankly misses the point. The reality is we have two failing governments in Scotland when it comes to climate change. We can't repeat the mistakes of the mining industry when entire communities were decimated and there wasn't a pathway to alternative employment. We can't make that same mistake in the North East.
