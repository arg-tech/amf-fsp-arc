They haven't made any noise about that. We know young people and the poorest in society have been the most affected by lockdown, the most affected by COVID. I don't see Labour making any point about that at all or doing anything useful in that regard. I think that is disappointing. I'd like to see them much stronger with clear views and policies, but I don't know what their policies are any more.

I have to respectfully disagree and I think Robert will bear witness to the fact that we have disagreed over many things. We have stood up for people -- for instance, we stood up for people on school meals, we stood up and got a reversal of a decision by the government. We stood up for people on the evictions ban, we stood up for people on cladding which is so important to so many people across the country. We are standing up for people right now when we do not want to see the economic devastation that would arise if the government carries on with its decision to cut Universal Credit by Â£30 each week, we've money laundering to achieve quite a lot of U turns out of the government. Not enough. I would like Robert to go further, but I think it is not fair to say that we haven't stood up to the government. I think Robert would say we've disagreed on many a case.
