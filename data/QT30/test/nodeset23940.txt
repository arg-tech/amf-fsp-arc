Victor Adebowale[0:13:48] If you are going to ask me whether we should risk that for a football match, I like football kind of, my answer is no! It's not worth it. There's no wealth without health. So, my view is caution. Honestly, negotiations around this Covid doesn't negotiate. I think we know that. It does not negotiate. It doesn't care who you are, or how important the event is, it will spread. In London, just to be clear, there's a lot of work to do in London, we have got 37% of adults have had two doses and we are talking about bringing a load of people into a place where we have still got work to do to bring the vaccinations up to standard. Now, I understand the pressures, I really do. I can see it. It's a balance. It's not easy. I'm not here to slag off one party or the other. I can understand it. But the science, and the evidence says no, we shouldn't be doing it. I tell you the fact of the matter is when people watch this, they will think hang on a minute, if they are doing it, why shouldn't I do it? We have got to this position because people like you have obeyed the rules. So we should be really cautious, we should be really clear about what we are saying to people. We should be consistent. Otherwise, this virus will not go away.Fiona Bruce[0:15:06] Kate?Kate Andrews[0:15:10] Yes. We should be cautious, we should be smart. But we do need to acknowledge the science.
