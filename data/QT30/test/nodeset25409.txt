Caroline Lucas[0:11:56] I have tried myself to find out how you hold the prime minister to account whether he lies, repeatedly. Let's be very clear this is a prime minister who lies repeatedly, systematically. The problem is the Judge, jury and courted is all the prime minister. There's no way of holding him to account. This is a bigger problem than Owen Paterson. I'm glad he resigned. It was grotesque to watch Parliament yesterday to see how all thetory MPs were criteria goodness into supporting this amount. I'm not sure what Paul Scully Paul Scully will think of it, but vote for it. It is extraordinary to see how people can be persuaded for something that is so manifestly wrong. So, yes, Tory liaise is back and idle a bad look.
