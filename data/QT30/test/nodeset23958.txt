[0:36:32] You know, I'm sick of hearing basically, in Parliament, you know a load of ministers and cabinet ministers laughing about women. Not just women but this is a serious issue! You know. It should be addressed. And yes I did take offence Fiona, I think it's absolutely disgusting.

Fiona Bruce
[0:36:52] Robert, do you cringe at that the Justice Secretary, or a good thing to say?

Robert Buckland
[0:36:56] First of all as somebody who prosecuted regularly with serious crimes, and dealt with abuse cases it's never been a laughing matter. Last week I apologised publicly for the low rate of convictions for rape cases in England and Wales. I can tell you.

Fiona Bruce
[0:37:18] So 1.4% of rape cases resulted in a conviction last year?

Robert Buckland
[0:37:22] We saw a rise at the beginning of the decade and a steep decline since then. That is of deep concern to me and everybody involved in the system. The system has failed because of multiplicity of reasons, including for example, the appalling position where a young woman who has made a complaint of rape is told look we need your phone, we want your mobile phone, we will take your phone from you maybe for months. We are not going to give it back to you. That makes, gives that person an unenviable choice, do they give their phone over with their life on it or pursue the complaint. Too many people are put in that position. Therefore cases are not followed through. I want to change all that. Can I say so does the Prime Minister. I take on board what the questioner has just asked.
