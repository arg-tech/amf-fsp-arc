Fiona Bruce [00:10:18] Do you support what Andy Burnham is saying, a Labour man, in terms of he doesn't want to see a further lockdown in his area, despite what you are saying? Seema Malhotra [00:10:26] I think one of the critical things is it hasn't been felt the way the decisions are made and the way the local leaders are involved is in any way near what we need to see. I don't understand why we have both a UK government that has over many years seen cut to local government, that has made local government less resilient, also the Scottish government has cut funding to local government in Scotland by much more than has been cut in terms of budgets from Westminster. This lack of resilience has made it increasingly difficult. But what we have seen is that local authority, when they have been able to go about track and trace, have actually been doing far better than the Serco and others on who the government is spending 12 billion. Also, the key thing that financial support has to go hand in hand with those restrictions. The government has not had the trust of local authority and local leaders that that is happening.
