Caroline Lucas[0:10:40] No matter what Robert says about the extra provisions you are still going to have more people close together and coming in from other countries while the Delta variant isn't circulating like it is in this country. Let's remember why it is circulating so much and that's because Boris Johnson was to inept and incompetent and irresponsible, he left three weeks before he put India on the red list and in that time we have the Delta variant circulating so much! And you know Boris Johnson says he is going to make, sensible accommodations with EUFA. What about making sensible accommodations people might argue with those people that haven't been able to see loved-ones for maybe near or two years now. What about sensible accommodations for people who desperately want to have more than 30 people at a wedding! This is just typical of a Government that runs the country in a divisive way that has double standards at its heart, it stinks.
Fiona Bruce[0:11:36] Does anyone in our audience, and depleted in numbers for the reasons we know. Anyone support the decision? Charlie let's hear from you.
