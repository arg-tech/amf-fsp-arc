Fiona Bruce [0:09:04] So, George, the question was, is it time to allow people to make their own decisions about how they approach this pandemic?
George Mpanga [0:09:12] Thanks for the question. I think people making their own decisions is contingent on them having reliable information, and unfortunately I don't get that from this Government. I don't feel like we're having consistent clear messaging. When the lockdown was initially imposed, it was very unclear, the details of that lockdown. As these measures have been eased, we have been told to factor in the R number, or the -- we make arbitrary decisions about what's appropriate behaviour where most of us can't really figure out what even the threshold for achieving what the Government was once describing as herd immunity would be. So, I take Steve's point about the British public not being stupid, but we really need clear and consistent messaging.
