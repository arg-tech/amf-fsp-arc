Katie[0:24:10] I think younger people don't necessarily have the opportunity to go into something like a trade, which is probably more valuable. I do think there is a community of people who want to be influencers and YouTubers and things like that. I'm not saying that's everyone. Obviously everyone is different, but I do feel like that is where people would probably find more work if they were interested in more like a trade rather than being an influencer.Fiona Bruce[0:24:38] Niamh.Niamh[0:24:38] Hi. I think I dread to think what it's going to be like. I graduated last September and I have been in between waiting to start my masters and saving money for that, and it was already next to impossible for me to find a job this year. So, with the pandemic and with Brexit, I dread to think what it's going to be like for those graduating this year. For me, the jobs that I did find were minimum wage, they didn't cover your living expenses, you had to top that up with benefits. There is unpaid internships, nothing is paid. They are given disproportionately to 018 / 33 privileged people.
