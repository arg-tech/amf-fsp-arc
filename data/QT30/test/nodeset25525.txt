FIONA BRUCE [00:38:46] Stuart, you have a question. 
STUART UNKNOWN [00:38:48] Good evening, panel. Yes. For those not in the initial bracket to receive the vaccine, will they still need to abide by the social distancing or even face the potential of going back into lockdown as well? 
FIONA BRUCE [00:39:02] How is this going to work? Is there to be a section of the population that can party while everyone else has to wait? 
MATT HANCOCK [00:39:14] Because at first we don’t know whether, even if you had the vaccine you might still transmit the disease, it means we can’t lift those measures on just the people who had the vaccine because you still might give it to somebody else. So what we have to do is vaccinate to protect the most vulnerable and then get to the position where enough people have had it. And we will, of course, monitor afterwards, as we vaccinate the population, to find out the impact on the transmission of the disease. All of this is about how to get life back to normal as fast as possible.[DONE] Another reason to do this, in terms of clinical priority, to your point earlier, the faster we can vaccinate those most vulnerable, the sooner we’ll be able to get life back to normal for everybody else as well. So this is another of those questions that at the moment is unknowable, but the plan to roll out according to clinical priority is the best way to get as fast as possible to as much back to normal as is possible.
