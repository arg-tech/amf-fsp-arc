Fiona Bruce[0:17:26] Okay.
Lucy Powell[0:17:28] We have an absence of leadership on that.
Fiona Bruce[0:17:30] Gillian, I'm sure you can answer all those questions. I'll come to you in a minute. Beth.
AudienceMember 20210805QT09[0:17:36] We saw the last time when there was varying local restrictions with nobody knowing what was happening and people leaving London before Christmas and going back up. It is an infectious disease that's not going to respect the borough boundary where you can't go to a nightclub. I think, ultimately, you need to think about delaying from 21st June to keep the rest of the country safe and to keep young people in the north-west safe as well.
Fiona Bruce[0:18:06] Dale.
AudienceMember 20210805QT10[0:18:08] Hi there. I think we just need to lift it and we know hospitalisations are going down and obviously the infection rates are, but nobody is going to hospital because that's going low...
Fiona Bruce[0:18:22] Just to be clear, hospitalisations are going up - no, they're going up slowly, very slowly, but not going down.
AudienceMember 20210805QT11[0:18:32] Okay, Fiona. But again, now we've gotten into a pandemic of mental health with people staying at home and being in lockdown. So, we now need to move from that and we know that we have to live with COVID and that is going to be our new norm. I think we need to lift it and the 21st needs to go back, try to go back to how we were before.
