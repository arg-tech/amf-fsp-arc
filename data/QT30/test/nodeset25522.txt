MATT HANCOCK [00:18:02] The priority is all about protecting people according to their risk from the virus. After we have gone down through the over 65s, according to the proposal, opposite the data that we’ve seen, and they may update it as we see more information, then you go to those who are particularly vulnerable from all age groups. After that, down to the over 50s. Once you get below the over 50s, there is less of a clinical justification for any particular ordering. [DONE]ROSIE JONES [00:18:46] What do you mean by below the over 50s? MATT HANCOCK [00:18:50] So for people who don’t have an illness which makes them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, who are aged between 18 and 50, they are the least likely to die from coronavirus so the clinicians who advise me on this expert panel say they come after all the people who are either older or work in health and social care or who have a particular vulnerability. Unfortunately, we know a lot about who is vulnerable to Covid because of having looked at who has been badly affected.
