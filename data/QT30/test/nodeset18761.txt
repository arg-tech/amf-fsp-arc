Fiona Bruce[0:10:08] Iona.Iona Bain[0:10:10] Well, I think that Suresh has quite rightly brought up the concerns about the economy, but also about people's mental and physical health during this time and obviously lockdown across the whole country is not sustainable, and therefore we have to find a way, as Theo has said, of living with the virus and having some distance from the virus and making sure we can do that safely until we find a vaccine or an effective treatment. And I also completely understand Kirsty and Kofie's concerns about coming back out into the society if they don't feel that it is absolutely 100% safe yet to be back out there and these are the two competing concerns that we're having to consider right now, and there are no easy choices to make. But when we look at what happened in Bournemouth today, I think we need to appeal to people's sense of responsibility, and I think most people have complied remarkably well with the lockdown, especially young people.
