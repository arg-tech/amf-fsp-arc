Fiona Bruce[0:45:08] 127,000 deaths.Deborah Frances-White[0:45:12] That's disgraceful. That's an outrage. We had this hokey-cokey lockdown of no, we're out, we're eating out to help out, now we're staying in to avoid dying. All of the confusion. It feels like now it is relevantly safe, we're locked in, but at Christmas we were all out when we weren't vaccinated, none of us were vaccinated, we were all out eating out to help out. It has been such --
Fiona Bruce[0:45:42] We weren't eating out to help out at Christmas. It was earlier.
Deborah Frances-White[0:45:48] We were let out a bit at Christmas.
Fiona Bruce[0:45:50] Do you think hospitality should open now or not?
Deborah Frances-White[0:45:54] I don't know because I'm getting my information from this government and they are the absolute worse. I wish I knew. But I look at Australia, at New Zealand, I say it could have been done and it could have been different. Yes, we did very well with vaccines, but why are people voting for the Conservatives in Hartlepool? It is a mystery to me. They are looking at the last bit, oh, we've been quickly vaccinated. You must feel really awful about 126,000 deaths as somebody in the Cabinet.
Robert Jenrick[0:46:30] Every death is one too many. But the point we're at now -- you are almost making the government for the government's roadmap. People want certainty, they want a roadmap they can have confidence in and that is what the roadmap is providing.
