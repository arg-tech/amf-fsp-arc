AudienceMember 20210805QT26[0:44:52] I think there are other more proactive ways to tackle racism and make statements without taking the knee, and I do think the more we see it, I think it becomes just the norm. It doesn't become something that's a dramatic step change, and I think the sentiment around it, it raises awareness, that's right, but I think people will get tired of it, much like they're tired of woke. Much like they're tired of being told what to think. So I respect that people do it. I understand why, but I do think it is starting to reduce the effect it had in the first place.

AudienceMember 20210805QT27[0:45:34] I have issues with the taking of the knee. I completely understand the sentiment behind it. Racism must not be tolerated in society at all, but we have got to change the mindset of people. We've got to change how people behave...
Fiona Bruce[0:45:54] Do you think taking the knee is not helpful to that anymore?
AudienceMember 20210805QT28[0:46:00] Actually, I don't understand what it is achieving. We've got to educate people. We have got to have a zero tolerance towards racism, and taking the knee is great and I absolutely am behind, you know, showing your support for anti-racism. You know how we're re-enacting the situation that George found himself at the end of his life and I'm not sure we should be replicating. We need more education and more actions in society and that's just the bottom line. We need to see more actions.
