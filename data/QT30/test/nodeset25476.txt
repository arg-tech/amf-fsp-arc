Michelle Dewberry[00:18:09] But if you're so keen on winning back people's trust, and Hartlepool has come up lots of times this evening already, why on earth in a by-election, in a place that's voted almost 70 per cent for Brexit, you're sitting there saying I want to win your trust back, you stick a remainer in there. If I was in Hartlepool as a resident, whether I was a former voter for Labour or considering voting for you, I would just be looking at you thinking are you guys mad?
Lisa Nandy[00:18:35] Look, Michelle, we didn't stick a remainer in there, because at the end of the day we've got to leave these labels behind. I'm somebody who campaigned and voted for remain…
Michelle Dewberry[00:18:44] But you did, that's exactly what you did.
Lisa Nandy[00:18:45] …and then tried to get a Brexit deal through and voted for it twice, under Boris Johnson before the election and since. And I'm sick to death of us all being labelled as leavers and remainers, as left behind communities, as oat drinking latte drinking, whatever it was that was said before.
Michelle Dewberry[00:19:01] It's representative of something.
Lisa Nandy[00:19:03] I'm sick of these labels. We've got to stop the division and we've got to start to bringing the country together again. We're in the middle of a global pandemic, we come through this together or we don't come through it at all.
