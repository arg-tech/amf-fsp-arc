Caroline Lucas[0:19:12] We still need that basic ability to be able to ensure that someone can self-isolate if they have tested positive. Right now we know huge numbers of people aren't doing that, they can't afford to. So that has to be part of this overall Covid suppression strategy. We have got nearly two million people it was said today who are living with long Covid, that can have debilitating impacts, I have been part of the all-party group on coronavirus, we have taken evidence from people with long Covid. It's not just people being a bit short of breath it's people running marathons one month and in wheelchairs the next. It's deeply serious. Let u forget that we don't have all of the population vaccinated yet. A little bit more caution for a little bit longer along with Public Health measures put in place will get us to the place that all of us really want to be!
Fiona Bruce[0:20:06] OK. I'm going to move on. We have got other questions that a lot of you wanted to hear asked. Let's move on to the question from Gary.
AudienceMember 20210722QT13[0:20:16] Good evening all. Considering no variance of concerns were detected by on any flights returning from the 167 amber list countries, between March 20th and June 9th when will the Government acknowledge that travelers returning from green and amber countries pose little risk to the British public and allow vaccinated people to travel without restriction?
