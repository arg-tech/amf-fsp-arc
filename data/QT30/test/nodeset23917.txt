AudienceMember 20210805QT23[0:43:34] It is not about being unpatriotic for taking the knee. It is about learning and knowing what Britain is now and that's a multi-cultural, diverse society where we need to accept that we need to be more tolerant and more respectful to people, and if this keeps the conversation going then keep taking the knee, and I'm all for it and it should reach the point until it is acceptable.
Fiona Bruce[0:44:02] Jo, what about you. I couldn't tell which bits you were agreeing with.
AudienceMember 20210805QT24[0:44:10] There has to be a degree of respect. It's a very tricky subject. I think people are very loathe to make their comments, as I am now, because you're -- if you disagree with taking the knee you're seen to be racist. You might not be racist whatsoever.
Fiona Bruce[0:44:26] What's your feeling, Jo? This is a forum to speak your mind. Do you feel that taking the knee isn't something you particularly want to see?
AudienceMember 20210805QT25[0:44:36] No. I don't think it is. What happened, when it was done initially, it had a really dramatic effect and people stood up and took notice, and now their attention has been got and we have seen it in sports throughout that they've all boycotted social media because of racism.
