Fiona Bruce[0:04:26] Steve, making decisions about how they want to approach a situation, is that what we have seen in Bournemouth today where a major incident was declared because so many people descended onto the beach?Steve Barclay[0:04:40] Obviously what we have seen is very disappointing today. As Theo said, the lockdown only works with the consent of the people, we have to trust the vast majority of people complied with the lockdown because they saw the advice from the chief medical centre, the advice from the chief scientific officer, they saw what was happening in our countries and recognised we needed to protect the NHS and take the lockdown as Theo says to save lives. That is the measures that we're taking. But it is a balance in terms of the questioner says is concerned as to the lockdown being too much, others like Jess feel it was insufficient. So we have got to trust the common sense of the British public.
