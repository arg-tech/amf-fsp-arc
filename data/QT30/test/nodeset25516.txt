Fiona Bruce [00:12:58] Devi, you wanted to come back in there.

Professor Devi Sridhar [00:12:58] Yeah. I mean, I don't think anyone's saying seal off the country. I'm saying that the system we have right now, the red, amber, green list, isn't working. You're having red and green list passengers mixing at airport terminals, and obviously the Indian variant has spread which shows that the system doesn't work. But there are other systems. The United States and the EU are opening to people who are fully vaccinated and if they have a negative PCR test, and, as you say, that's much lower risk because you're unlikely to pass it on. It happens, but it's a much smaller risk. So I think we should be transitioning to that system rather than on this red, amber, green, which is just confusing, and if that means we need to wait a few more months, we'll have everyone done by mid-July, at least one dose, accelerating hopefully by August, so by October there's a real chance to open up with vaccine passports across the world, which is what we'd done with yellow fever, and I think this is the way the world is going. So in a way it's just patience now for a few more weeks and then that holiday will come.
