Kirsty[0:06:56] In Brighton today already the beaches were incredibly crowded and I feel that like if we reduce lockdown any more things like that are going to happen. We had tonnes of people coming down to Brighton and I can't do anything. I don't look ill, so when I'm out and about and I have started, just starting to go out into the society, people don't know I'm ill so people can -- my health is relying on other people's actions and that's quite scary, because I feel very out of control of my own situation.
