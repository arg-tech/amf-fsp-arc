Fiona Bruce[0:50:10] Do you have the power to make that happen or will you just talk about it?Robert Jenrick[0:50:14] There's a lot of things the government can do. We can pass laws, we can regulate the game more. You saw from the decisive action the Prime Minister and Culture Secretary took that we do have the power to intervene and to make things happen. I'm pleased that we killed that proposal and I hope we can use this as an opportunity to make the game more dynamic, more democratic and more in the interests of the fan who ultimately -- that's what the game is all about.Thangam Debbonaire[0:50:46] I'm glad that the government has heeded the call of my colleague, the Shadow Minister of Sport. We have been calling for many a long year for fans to be in charge of what happens in their clubs, as they are in other countries. I think we need to see this followed through now, not just a convenient sound-bite at election time. It has to be followed through.
