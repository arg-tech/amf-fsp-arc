AudienceMember 20210819QT20[0:51:10] Well, look, I'm not an expert at football but some years the dynamics in top sport have been changing very dramatically so that the money that flows into these clubs rather than coming from the immediate fans in person has moved far more towards the media rights, sponsorship rights and all these other rights that they manage to sell. This has become a much more important source of income for all these clubs than the fans themselves. In a sense, something like this was always bound to happen. I think it is good that it has come to a head now because the -- you know, the people, both the players, the managers, the owners of these clubs, they need always to remember that ultimately they are dependent on the fans. They are there to play sport but they are also there to entertain. And I'm actually pleased that it has come to a crunch.
