FIONA BRUCE [00:56:36] A different question on another topic, from Jay. JAY UNKNOWN [00:56:42] Having had a Disability Discrimination Act for 25 years, are we now treating people with more respect and equality? FIONA BRUCE [00:56:50] Rosie, I’m not trying to pigeon-hole you here, but in a sense you are the obvious person. ROSIE JONES [00:56:58] Why? FIONA BRUCE [00:57:00] I can’t imagine. But give us the benefit of your experience. ROSIE JONES [00:57:04] The Disability Act came in in ’95. I was 5 years old and, without a doubt, my life has been better because of it. I had an education in a mainstream school. I went to university. I got a job, and with my cerebral palsy have been a successful and independent human being. And I am proud of who I am and I can wee in disabled toilets and park where I want because of this groundbreaking Disability Act. Saying that, 25 years on and whenever I walk in the street alone, I wear headphones because of how I walk and I talk, I get abuse on a daily basis. I am not alone in that. I am not alone in that. I have had times of unemployment. Unemployment is huge among disabled people. I tried to apply for jobs and I have been hung up on because of how I speak. And I’m not alone because right now a quarter of a million disabled people are unemployed and because of Covid, that is rising. I was going to say that disabled people are overlooked. But they’re not. They are deliberately ignored because disabled people need more care and more money and I don’t feel like, as a disabled person, I am getting the care and support I need right now.
