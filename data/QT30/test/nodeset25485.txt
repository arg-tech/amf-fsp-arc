Angela Haggerty[0:45:52] People are strategising to follow this. It is a boring procedure. You have to recognise that Nicola Sturgeon's popularity is at quite incredible levels right now. It really is, considering how long the SNP have been in government. That's quite unusual. And where it might be conventional if you were found to have misled Parliament or broken the ministerial code, it might be convention for those normally to resign, but these aren't normal times. I don't think there is public appetite out there for the removal of Nicola Sturgeon from office. So I'm not -- I don't think that this is the big Nicola Sturgeon downfall that some of the opponents think. More broadly than that, the idea of splits with the SNP, you have to remember that after 2014 the SNP had a massive surge in membership and they were coming from different walks of life, the left, the right and the centre. They were all conjugating with the SNP on the constitutional issue of independence. So there's no way that the SNP could possibly have provided a political home for them all long-term.
