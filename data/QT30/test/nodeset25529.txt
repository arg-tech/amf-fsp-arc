EMILY UNKNOWN [01:04:30] I just want to applaud Rosie for challenging you all on that. I want to raise an issue that was mentioned about SDN and children struggling in schools. The delays for diagnosis of difficulties is three years. Covid is going to increase that delay. Disability Discrimination Act gave us the rights to education. There are lots of children who can’t access education because they are still waiting for a diagnosis. What is going to be done about that?

DONNA UNKNOWN [01:05:04] I think England it is important to remember that any one of us could become disabled at any point in time. So when we’re supporting an increase in access for disabled people we’re actually supporting ourselves, we’re supporting the entire country. So I think looking at this as, you know, as issues that are just for disabled people is just -- I don’t think it is helpful. It is about how do we increase access for all of us, including disabled people. That’s how I think we should look at this. [DONE]
