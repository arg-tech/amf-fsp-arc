Fiona Bruce [00:08:42] Peter, in terms of the logistics, a fantastic breakthrough to have a vaccine, never mind a couple coming down the pipeline. What about getting it out to people? Peter Openshaw [00:08:54] This is a tremendous triumph of science that we got this far. I think we are up to the logistic challenge and that’s because we have a system in the NHS that can deliver vaccines at scale. We have tremendous networks which are already present throughout the country. I don’t think we need to put in a whole new command and control system in order to do this because we do have the people already up for this particular challenge. I think the problem about breaking up the batches and getting them out into care homes is an important one. We know the best way to deliver vaccines is at the point where people are assembled in work places, schools, so on. We always know that’s the best way to do it. So I think we must find ways of getting around the logistical problems, which are because of having only four stages that you’re allowed by the regulations to stage this vaccine as it comes from the factory into the delivery points. But I think that is surmountable. It just needs a lot of work.
