Deborah Frances-White[0:21:22] No. I feel he wasn't outraged. He didn't say it was appalling. His first response was not to say: This cannot stand. All the people going out with Kill the Bill I don't think he is with us. But I want him to listen and I feel maybe he will. On the up side he seems like a statesperson, he seems like a grownup.

But I would love to see more from him on Black Lives Matter, I would love to see more from him on really going out and being in opposition. But I value that he doesn't oppose things that shouldn't be opposed just for the sake of opposing them.
