Frank Luntz[0:52:56] That's why the show is so special. This is the best English-speaking programme on television.

Fiona Bruce[0:53:02] We will have you back!

Frank Luntz[0:53:04] You have got 25 people there who get a chance to articulate whatever they want. You guys have a chance to respond to the public. This is what we need more of. If we had more shows like this, more opportunities like this, there would be less anger and less frustration and less people feeling like they're ignored or forgotten. Your participants matter and that's what we need to do in our democracy and that's what we need to do in business and society overall.

Fiona Bruce[0:53:34] Alex, I know you wanted to come back in.

AudienceMember 20210805QT30[0:53:40] I'm conflicted about it. I don't watch football. The only time I have seen footballers taking the knee is when it is showing on the news. I used to go to the theatre a lot...

Fiona Bruce[0:53:52] You used to.

AudienceMember 20210805QT31[0:53:54] I hope to again in the not too distant future, but it would become frustrating if the actors came out and took the knee and it would become a pantomime. I think it is the right message, but wrong forum.
