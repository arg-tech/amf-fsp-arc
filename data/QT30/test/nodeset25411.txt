Fiona Bruce[0:08:01] Alex Massie.Alex Massie[0:08:03] Yes. I think at the beginning of (inaudible) there were an awful lot of people across the United Kingdom who, even if they had not voted for Boris Johnson wished him well. They recognised it was important the Government had a grip on this cricis and rose to the challenge and the occasion.Alex Massie[0:08:23] I think those sentiments were reinforced obviously when the Prime Minister fell ill himself. The events of the last week I think have enormously dented public confidence in the UK's Government to handle this crisis because people have seen and understood and it has been based on their own experience and difference between the way they have behaved and the way in this instance Dominic Cummings has behaved.They can tell the difference between these two things. You know, you can sympathise with the predicament in which Dominic Cummings and family find themselves while recognising at the same time many other people, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, have faced comparable situations. They have obeyed and followed the Government advice and stayed at home. It is not unreasonable for them to expect people at the highest levels of Government to do likewise.
