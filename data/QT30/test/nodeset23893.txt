Fiona Bruce[0:12:06] Therefore, not to ban sausages and other chilled meats going to Northern Ireland. Is that likely to happen?

Gillian Keegan[0:12:12] One of the things that I've learnt, these agreements are nothing like any business agreement that I did in the 30 years I was a commercial negotiator...

Fiona Bruce[0:12:24] I'm not surprised. It was undoing a trade deal of 40 years.

Gillian Keegan[0:12:28] I've read tonnes of these things now. They're written in a different level. They're written at a very different level so you can get these things started and then they evolve over time. So, it does need to have good faith and good faith negotiations and discussions. They absolutely require that. Now, we have been in this position before where there has been a bit of a leverage play, it goes up to the wire, it seems to be what happens, but hope with President Biden urging some sense as well that we can come into the room and have a sensible -- it isn't actually rocket science to sort it out. If there is trust and will, you can come up with solution. As Tony said, nobody thinks that the sausages or meat will be swarming into the EU and upsetting some balance of trade or that they're going to be unsafe. Neither of those things are true, but they are deliberately at a different level which is something I found interesting when I started to work in politics as opposed to business.
