Fiona Bruce[0:32:28] So, Steve, lots of ideas being thrown in your direction. Targeted jobs for young people, Iona talking about a commission, more emphasis on entrepreneurship.
Steve Barclay[0:32:40] What I can reassure Theo, there is no shortage of graft in the Treasury. If you look at the schemes that are put in place at speed like the furlough, the grants and so forth, have covered a lot to protect jobs, but I absolutely agree, then the next phase to that is how then for those jobs we're not able to protect, and the Chancellor has been very candid; we can't protect every job. There will be changes and, as the questioner picked up, there are changes in the way people are working, the use of on-line. If you look at GPs, only 3% were using on-line, GP surgeries before the pandemic. Now, it's up to 9%, so pretty much all. So there are changes to how people are operating on-line. That will change the work place and we're in very active discussions with employers, particularly small and medium employers, to see what schemes we can put in place to support them. But the first priority was protect as many jobs as possible. Over 9 million have been through the furlough scheme, but we then need to look at the next phase, which is how, particularly on things like apprenticeships, we get the right skills working with the National Citizens Service as well, get the right careers advice, skills, the right training for people moving forward.
