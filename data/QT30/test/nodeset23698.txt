Fiona Bruce[0:11:18] Sticking with the subject a minute. Sticking with this subject a minute. In terms of the headway that you are making, part of the reason Boris Johnson is talking about this every day is because you won't let it go, I'm not saying whether you are right or wrong but you don't seem to be making headway. To the people out there so Dave and Martin and Colette was shaking her head and thinking this subject doesn't really matter that much, how can you convince people like that that this does matter.
Daisy Cooper[0:11:48] This anomaly has only just appeared and there's clearly time for the story to run. It should matter. The election commission which is a financial regulator sees the evidence and they think there are reasonable grounds to investigate this. That is a very serious matter and the public are reserving judgment to see what comes out. People should worry Downing Street could have come clean at the start of this week. They have refused to do so. We know the Prime Minister has appointed a so-called independent investigator but the Prime Minister himself can veto the publication of that investigator's report. He is hardly independent at all. The point I was trying to make is this is a real scandal and the real scandal of this story is that hundreds of thousands of leaseholders this week will be left without any financial protection for remediating fire safety defects and cladding on their flats whilst the Prime Minister and his team are concerned about papering-over a story about how he has refurbished his flat.
