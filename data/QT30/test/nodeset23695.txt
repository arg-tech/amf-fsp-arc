Fiona Bruce[0:06:30] Tim? You have been listening and shaking your head a bit I noticed.
Tim Stanley[0:06:34] Laughter. On the one hand, it's Number 10's fault because it won't answer that question of who initially paid for it. When it doesn't do that, that opens the possibility of speculation.
Fiona Bruce[0:06:46] Why do you think they are not answering the question? At Number 10?
Tim Stanley[0:06:50] Sorry?
Fiona Bruce[0:06:54] Why are they not answering the question?
Tim Stanley[0:06:56] Presumably because the answer is embarrassing that's the only reason why they don't give it. I don't know why they don't give it. Everyone has assumed that there's something underneath the iceberg. I'm not sure there, and it's worth bearing in mind that lots of politicians have charged the taxpayer to redecorate residences in this instance the Prime Minister has paid for it himself. It's also worth bearing in mind that the original blind trust idea he is reported to have come up with is how parts of the US presidency is financed at the White House, it's not internationally ununusual at all. The thing with Boris Johnson is people voted for him knowing he doesn't do things the normal way. He is an unusual character. But they wanted that! They wanted someone who cut through what they regarded as a stagnant, frozen political system to get things done. What Boris Johnson will be saying in the run-up to the all-important Hartlepool by-election is I got us out of the EU and I rolled out a world-leading vaccine programme.
