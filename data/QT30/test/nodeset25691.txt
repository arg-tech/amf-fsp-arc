Paul Polman[0:59:22] If the government look at it holistically, 90 or 100 percent of these can be solved. It is the same for business. We should stop competing with each other on the future of humanity, include in politics, and start working together like adults on these things for the benefit of mankind. We have the technology. We know what we have to do, and we don't have time.Fiona Bruce[0:59:50] Paul, thank you. I'm going to move on. We could talk about climate change all evening, it is a massive topic, hugely important. There's another question a lot of you submitted this evening. I'm just picking one of them.AudienceMember 20211111QT22[1:00:06] Can a racist term ever be defined as banter?Fiona Bruce[1:00:10] What you are talking about here is the furore there's been over Azeem Rafiq who claims he was subjected to institutional racism at his club, and he clearly feels that this has not been handled properly and Yorkshire has carried out its own investigation, ruled no disciplinary action would take place, called it banter. Tim.Tim Stanley[1:00:44] The answer is no. There's nothing else to say. I don't see how the club can explain its decision to not take further action other than, I suppose, hypothetically, perhaps, there was a reluctance to do something that might damage the career of a star player. I don't know. But that's purely speculative. No, that particular term is totally unacceptable.
