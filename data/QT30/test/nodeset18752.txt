Fiona Bruce[0:08:16] Suresh you asked the question.
Audience Speaker[0:08:20] Thank you for letting me respond, I completely agree with what Theo said. I do think that the lockdown being implemented when it was implemented was the correct time. But I think now the indirect effect of the lockdown, nobody can quantify, you can't quantify the massive impact to people's mental health. They have been away from education for six months. People are missing cancer appointments. Cancer is a potent disease. So who -- I think the lockdown should be eased as quickly as possible in a safe way and people are now aware of the risks, so they can choose to accept those, and I think the economy does need to get moving as well as other issues too. So I do welcome the lockdown being eased slowly.
