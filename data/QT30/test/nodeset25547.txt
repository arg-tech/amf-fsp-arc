Fiona Bruce[00:29:39] Well, I think they are putting their resources together for the benefits of this particular app, as I understand it. Charles?
Charles[00:29:48] Yes. It just seems that this is just another moment of government bluster actually hitting reality. So, Matt Hancock and Baroness Harding said today that they’ve backed both horses of the Google and the android model and the NHS app, but they’ve always insisted until this point that they were only going to pursue the NHS app. So it just seems that the government are trying to make it seem that they’re trying to do the best job possible, but when it comes to reality they might cover up and not pretend that they’ve done anything wrong.
Fiona Bruce[00:30:19] Jed?
Jed Mercurio[00:30:20] Well, I think that the app can only really be an adjunct. I think that there are technological limitations in the app in terms of providing a nation-wide service. And really, it’s about having a functioning public health infrastructure that is able to deal with local outbreaks locally. And unfortunately, the government has chosen to centralise and use a private company, Cerco, to take the lead on this. And I think that a lot of public health officials and workers, as Lisa said, are frustrated that they’re not receiving the information.
