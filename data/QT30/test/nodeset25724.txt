Jon Ashworth[0:54:56] Well, I mean, the way in which this pandemic has impacted upon those in receipt of Adult Social Care is possibly one of the cruelest and most brutal savage consequences of the crisis. For somebody to be in Social Care, of course they need to be protected and not exposed to virus, and of course, staff have to have proper PPE, and of course, loved-ones have to be tested and so on. But to not allow a resident to see their loved-ones more than once a week, or whatever the particular procedure is in that care home I just think is scandalous, and it doesn't have to be like that now when we have got PPE in place, and infection control procedures in place when there's vaccination being rolled-out and testing.
