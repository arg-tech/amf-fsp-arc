Fiona Bruce[0:18:10] It is interesting you don't say no, would a Labour defeat mean curtains for Keir. Maybe his position is not that secure.Thangam Debbonaire[0:18:20] I think Keir has had a mountain to climb over the last year. It has been a very, very long year. Difficult for everybody. A marred year for everybody. I think one of the things we learned in this election is people are willing to listen to Labour again, willing to talk to us. We'll see what the results are like over the next few days.Fiona Bruce[0:18:38] Brian.AudienceMember 20210819QT11[0:18:40] I think it has been clear over the last couple of years that the Labour Party has faced a battle for identity following Jeremy Corbyn's resignation, we have seen the Labour Party trying to reinvent themselves. As a young person I want to see Labour try to convince me, show me they stand for things, show me they are a party I can put my faith and trust in. The Labour is a party I always want to believe in and trust, but I think they need to convince young voters like myself that they are standing up for us.Fiona Bruce[0:19:16] What could they say to convince you?AudienceMember 20210819QT12[0:19:18] To be honest, I want a vision of some sort. Whether that's on how they can make housing affordable, how they have a plan for effective spending which can help to alleviate poverty within the UK. Just measures they can put in place to safeguard the long-term future of not only myself but people who come after myself.
