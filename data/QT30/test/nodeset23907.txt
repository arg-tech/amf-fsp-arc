Lucy Powell[0:31:20] We will see a rise in military conflict and other issues that affect us here at home. That's why we have that moral obligation for foreign aid spending of 0.7% of GDP, something the Labour Party brought in because we had a very, very low base in aid spending beforehand and it has worked for us.
Frank Luntz[0:31:42] It is not how much you spend, it is how you spend it. Is the impact meaningful and measurable? Do you actually change people's lives and can you prove it through the data afterward? The public doesn't oppose foreign spending, it doesn't oppose foreign aid. They simply want it to be efficient, effective and accountable, so you get more for less, so you actually do what you promise you're going to do and, if you fail, people are held accountable.
Lucy Powell[0:32:12] It is the worst of all worlds, then. The Government are saying they're only going to cut it this year...
Frank Luntz[0:32:18] Why do you always attack the Government? They're asking for solutions. This was a specific policy and everything the Government does is correct. No, it's not. If we want to action that, this is my commitment and this is why I'm here in the UK, to make a difference in the democracy. I know how much the US has been destroyed by debates like this. I know that we can't have these conversations anymore without insulting each other.
