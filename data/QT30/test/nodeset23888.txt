Fiona Bruce[0:05:12] Sausage wars, we heard Lord Frost saying we under estimated the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland, effectively saying the Government didn't understand what it had signed up to and it is having to deal with it.Gillian Keegan[0:05:34] To trade agreements are complex...Fiona Bruce[0:05:40] When you say it is the difference between what we say.Gillian Keegan[0:05:44] Let me get it out. They have the legal right to inspect every sausage. They probably have the legal right to open every packet and inspect every sausage. Is that reasonable? Is that necessary? So what happens when you put these things in place and sometimes they take a bit of time which is why we had this period to bed things in to get some of the practicalities out, but what happens is there is many things you have. You get trusted trade status. We know that sausage is staying in a supermarket in Northern Ireland and it is going to a frying pan in Northern Ireland. It is not going to the EU. You get sensible practical solutions. We have had the period of time which was supposed to iron out some of the technicalities, and what happened, they are using the legal right to basically make it impossible almost to get these goods on to the shelves in Irish supermarkets...
