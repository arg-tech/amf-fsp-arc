Male Aud 8 [00:52:23] Testing is one thing, tracking is another one, but it’s the speed of results of the test which is important. I was desperate to get back to work when I was tested, but it took three days for my results to come back. I was desperate, because I knew I was needed in work. But, when you hear stories like, getting your eyes tested, by driving a certain amount of miles, and the lack of leadership. Yes, the majority of people might get their results, but for healthcare workers, I think it’s important that the speed of reporting should be quicker. Not only that, the results and the statistics that we look for, we need to have those results quicker, we need to learn from Korea, where the results come within a day, and then the track and testing process is much faster with isolation. So, we needed to learn much quicker from Korea, and other countries who have dealt with it, rather than wait for lack of leadership, and not condemning what the Prime Minister’s aid did or the other ingredients within the whole recipe of protecting people. I feel much safer with this two metre rule over here, but then the lack of PPE, hearing stories and the report coming out about ethnic minority doctors, why they’re dying more than the others, these are the issues that we need to have clear recommendations, to make sure that we are moving in the right direction. We need to protect every life that we can.
