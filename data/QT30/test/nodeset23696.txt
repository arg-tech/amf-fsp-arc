Tim Stanley[0:08:04] Judge me not on the character assassinations but on the basis of what I got done. Think back to when we were run by someone who dotted all the i's and dotted the ts and did everything to the letter, Theresa May, her Government was a disaster. So lots of voters are going to judge whatever has happened and it's purely speculative, they voted for Boris Johnson to get certain things done, he has been getting them done, and they don't really care how he pays for the wallpaper.
Fiona Bruce[0:08:34] Martin you are agreeing let's hear what you have got to say?
AudienceMember 20210916QT05[0:08:40] Hi. Yes. Do we really care? I think the general public, they are well aware of Boris Johnson and his failures. I think Jonathan has to be careful because all politicians are tarred with the similar brush, and kind of reeks of the expenses scandal.
Fiona Bruce[0:09:00] Dave?
AudienceMember 20210916QT06[0:09:06] Pause. Three words come to mind, honesy, integrity, and transparency. Danny has mentioned transparency. It's very difficult, and I agree with Martin as well. At the end of the day, you know, everybody needs to be accountable. Everybody needs to be transparent. We expect a certain amount of moral standing with politicians in one sense, but in another, we don't. It's a strange situation because we know that there are back-handers going on. We know there's all sorts of different aspects to politics which as a person you know, a UK citizen, I'm fully aware, and I'm not aware of all the backhanders that go on, and all the inside conversations.
