Steve Parish[00:38:54] But it’s also about people receiving accurate information. When you have public health officials, when you have government scientists saying things which are manifestly untrue, which is that it wasn’t appropriate, it was actually always about resources but they didn’t admit that. And so now we’re in a situation again where trust has broken down. People are desperate to get good quality information they can rely on from their government, from their public health officials, so that people can make the right decisions and make the right calculations about risk about how we get back to normal.
Munira Wilson[00:39:30] I think, though, Steve, you talked… Sorry, is it okay?
Fiona Bruce[00:39:32] Briefly, you know, because I just want to move onto another question.
Munira Wilson[00:39:34] Okay. You talked about ending the blame game. I think the public appreciate that we are in an unprecedented situation and no government is going to get it right. But the thing that frustrates me most about this government is that they just don’t have the humility to put their hands up when they’ve actually got it wrong, or they’ve been too late.
