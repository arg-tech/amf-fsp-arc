Michael Forsyth[0:14:38] If we had done that last year, the moment you release the lockdown it gets back into the community. What has changed is that we have a vaccine. If you have the population vaccinated, then having a lockdown you can get out of the lockdown and you can save the jobs and the costs, which are enormous. Our economy is hedge raging, every day our debts are going up. So we need to balance the health needs against the economic needs of the country.Jeane Freeman[0:15:12] That is the wrong balance. One of the audience said, quite rightly, unless you get the health needs sorted, the economy will go down the tank anyway because people will get seriously ill, they will die and our NHS will be overwhelmed. People understand that that's why they are doing all the things they are doing. On the vaccine, the vaccine isn't a magic bullet. The vaccine is one of the really important layers of protection but right now we do not know for sure how effectively it is on transmission. We know that it protects you from serious illness and death -- not completely, but very well, indeed -- but we don't know that it stops you transmitting the virus from one person to another. That is critical information.
