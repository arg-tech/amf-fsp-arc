Fiona Bruce[0:00:48] Exports of sausages and other chilled meat from Britain to Northern Ireland will effectively be banned at the end of this month because they are not coming from within the EU.Lucy Powell[0:01:00] They are subject to a lot of checks and the Prime Minister said that the Northern Ireland protocol was ingenious and would not result in checks or barriers or border, but that's what we are seeing and in effect there is a border down the Irish Sea.Fiona Bruce[0:01:16] What would you do differently?Lucy Powell[0:01:20] Well, what we are saying, which is what Biden is calling for, the British Government should align with the EU when it comes to food standards and veterinary services and that would get rid of most of the issues that we're seeing because the Government said they want high standards in food safety and so on, so there shouldn't be any problem for that.
