Kofie[0:07:28] I am a BAME man. I also live with a vulnerable person, who happens, like myself, to be became and we have seen a lot covered on the news about how the became community in particular are very vulnerable. And when we look at the countries who have looked at lockdown, we have seen that there have been some spikes in the virus. Now, obviously the Government, they are dealing with two priorities. So one is to protect lives and the other is to protect the economy. So, I am just wondering if we're doing both like what sort of plan is the Government going to come up with to make sure that two and two don't sort of come together here and that we are also ensuring that those who are particularly vulnerable and those of the BAME community in particular will be protected while lifting these restrictions.
