Fiona Bruce[0:38:32] Becky, you've had your hand up throughout this.
AudienceMember 20210805QT20[0:38:34] Yeah. I would agree completely with the points that have just been made. I do think it is shameful and I think we're almost forgetting the human side of this. You know, countries are these conceptual things where we put borders and barriers in place and there were wars to try to get more land and power, and there are parts of this globe where there is suffering and people are dying and suffering as we speak, and then you've got other parts where there is a massive amount of wealth. I don't think it is helpful to compare ourselves to other countries and say, "Well, we're doing more than they are so we're fine." Well, they're still suffering, while there is evidence to show that the contributions are making a massive difference, we should continue to make them, plus send vaccines over. I don't think they should be decreasing funding at this time. I think it is ridiculous.
Fiona Bruce[0:39:26] Okay. We've got another question I want to take now from Will. Will Drakes.
