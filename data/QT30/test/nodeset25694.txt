Minette Batters[0:30:04] Why has it come to this point? We have been asking for this, Nadhim, for a long time. Why has it come to this when people are losing their businesses?Nadhim Zahawi[0:30:14] The abattoirs have had a -- the China market close to them which is also impacted the industry here in the UK, but we are doing everything we can to make sure that we get things like the English language requirement resolved to make sure that we have the need for those abattoirs to process as fast as possible. This isn't something that, you know, has happened just in the UK. You're seeing global shortages everywhere because the global economy has rebounded rapidly post-pandemic. You're seeing it -- today, a few hours ago on the German economy, falling behind on manufacturing because of shortages of labour and this is happening globally. We're doing everything we can, in my view, to work with the farming community. I think you're right, yes, of course, Boris is right to say you've got to pay higher wages, invest in capital and you get the tax break on that, but we have got to be pragmatic and do what we're doing as we're doing because butchers are on the visa list to be able to come to this country and do that work.
