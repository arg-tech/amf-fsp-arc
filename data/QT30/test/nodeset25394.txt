Kate Andrews[0:17:44] They are very real pressures. They have been there since long before the pandemic.

Victor Adebowale[0:17:48] The pandemic has made them worse, and that's what I thought we might agree on.

Kate Andrews[0:17:54] And if we are to follow the data, and not the dates, the SAGE scenario for where we would be at hospitalisations right now is significantly higher than where we actually are. I don't want us to talk-down the huge success of the vaccines, and we immediate to follow the idea of the NHS being overwhelmed is deeply frightening but there's really good reason at the moment looking at the data as it is, we know things could change, to think that the link between infection and hospitalisation is not just watered-down. There is quite a good break. We all keep an open mind on these things and the Prime Minister and his freedom delay wanted to buy himself more time to look at the data. It's looking really positive and I think we should be quite cheerful about that.

Victor Adebowale[0:18:38] The data is softening the link but it's not broken that's the point I was trying to make, and that's about the caution.

Caroline Lucas[0:18:44] I think there's a real concern about

Victor Adebowale[0:18:44] Just saying

Caroline Lucas[0:18:48] And vaccination alone is not the way out of this. Of course it's been amazing and all credit to everyone. But on its own it's not going to get us to safety. Interestingly Kate mentioned Israel, and it's seeing cases going back up again. The point is we need to put in place something that this Government has failed to do from the start which is the basic public health provisions around test, trace, and supported isolation so that we are not only relying on the vaccination.
