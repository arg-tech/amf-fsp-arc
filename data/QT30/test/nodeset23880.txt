Fiona Bruce[0:55:36] Let's not forget some of these billionaires have stumped up the money for the players.
John Bercow[0:55:44] That's a sore point. I'm an Arsenal supporter. My particular bug bear is if you are going to have billionaires involved, and I would like to see much greater fan control, it would be a good start if those people cared a flying flamingos goal about the sport of football. The problem with Stan Chronicy, whose temerity, whose audacity, whose cheek, sheer chutzpah beggars belief, me doesn't know one end of a football pitch from the other. He is based in the United States, never comes to the UK, and my message to him is the same as Ian Wright's, Stan Chronicy, get out of our club.
