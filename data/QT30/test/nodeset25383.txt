Nelufar Hedayat[0:43:28] I look to Rory, and I nod, and I look to James, and I nod, to Lisa, and Mehdi, and what are you talking about? None of yous know what you're saying. That's what you did. You helped those four girls hold that poster up, and you helped a bunch of people hold a national flag of a national identity. I don't want to get soppy about it because the death falling from the skies falling from an aeroplane are still real, but it's a bittersweet thing. You must hold on to that.
Fiona Bruce[0:43:56] You want to come back? [Applause].
AudienceMember 20210902QT35[0:44:04] (28) As you alluded to, there are pockets of anti-Taliban resistance, whether it is people on the street, people in Panjir Province. My question really is to those of you with political power: are we going to let them stand alone? Are we in the United Kingdom going to let them stand alone?
James Cleverly[0:44:24] This is a really, really important point. I think, just because the situation now is tragic, and because we didn't achieve everything that we wanted to achieve, it doesn't mean to say we achieved nothing, and we did achieve a generation of young women who have had the opportunity to learn, and we do absolutely need to work to protect those gains, and fragile as they are, and that means working with the countries in the immediate vicinity around Afghanistan, that means working with countries that have a degree of influence over the Taliban. That is about making it absolutely clear that we are not just going to walk away from applying leverage, and applying pressure, and trying to make this situation as good as it can be.
