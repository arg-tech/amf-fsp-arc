Fiona Bruce[0:52:02] Time just to fit in one last question. In terms of decriminalisation of rape, those were the words Caroline you were quoting of the Victims' Commissioner of England and Wales.
Caroline Lucas[0:52:16] It means to say there's so little follow-up in the Criminal Justice system.
Fiona Bruce[0:52:24] I want to get this in.
AudienceMember 20210722QT29[0:52:26] Good evening Fiona. Panel. Will banning junk food ads before 9pm really stop us eating what we want?
Fiona Bruce[0:52:34] Victor?
Victor Adebowale[0:52:38] Well there's evidence that actually it will! So, I think we do need to do a lot more than just ban junk food ads after 9. There's also something about the responsibility supermarkets, I sit on the board of the Co-op group, I should tell you that, there's more we could do to educate people about good diets, and to educate children about how to cook. There's more we could do about food poverty.
