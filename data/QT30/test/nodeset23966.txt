Caroline Lucas[0:47:12] We need to stop this digital strip search. We need to have a ban I think on s history evidence! I don't think that's relevant. It shouldn't be bringing up in court. We need to have things like special advocates who can accompany rape survivors through the system because it's really difficult, and complex, and stressful and so forth. We need to have I think proper review of the cross-examination rules. We might even need to look at potentially alternatives to the jury, and at least an education of the jury. There are so many cultural rape things in people's minds that some people feel they are not getting a fair deal from jury trials. We need a sustainable funding model and Victor is right to talk about the shameful cuts to Rape Crisis centres, absolutely they need to be properly-funded. I think as well we need to be prepared to reopen historic cases. I know that's a big ask. We should be doing that. That is what justice demands. There's a huge amount that needs to be done. I'm afraid this review is basically re-warming some old pilots that have been already studied, and we don't really need more pilots.
