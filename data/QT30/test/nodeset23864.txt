[0:34:18] The other thing SAGE said in the same report was the data collected offers an opportunity to understand the environments where people spend time but does not give definitive notification on where, when and how transmission considered.
 What they are saying is the system is not detailed enough for them to be able to say with any high degree of certainty exactly where people are contracting COVID. That goes for hospitality as well as anywhere else.

[0:34:48] Andrea, you are supplying food to the hospitality industry, aren't you?

Yes. So I work for a fresh produce supplier in Scotland. We are the largest in Scotland and part of the supply chain to hotels and restaurants. The rules are slightly different in Scotland than England. In Scotland we are allowed to serve food inside with no alcohol up until 8 p.m., which is ridiculous. What we are seeing is in about 10 days' time people will be able to go to indoor concerts, up to 100 people. But what we're seeing is maybe four adults cannot have a meal indoors and have a glass of wine with their meal. It is ludicrous. It is absolutely crazy. The business owners all across the UK have adapted their businesses to make sure there are safe places to go. They have worked really hard to fit in with the guidelines. This industry is literally on its knees. Businesses are closing all over the place. We have to get it moving as fast as we can.
