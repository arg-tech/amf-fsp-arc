[0:08:04] Look when I first heard about this I asked a lot of questions and you know, I was asking myself a lot of questions about what was going on here. I mean John Whittingdale the minister yesterday made an announcement with the circumstances in which these people would come which sounds to me akin to almost hotel quarantine in the sense they would only be allowed to stay in a designated place, travel in designated transport units, and stay away from other people akin to I suppose a work visit.

[0:08:38] What's the rationale? The reason the Government is doing this risking the wroth of so many people?

Robert Buckland
[0:08:44] I think the rationale is putting it absolutely straight that we want to attract a major international football tournament to the UK. I think that they bring a lot of joy, and they bring a lot of revenue for our businesses and our industries across the country, and therefore it is right that we do try and play on that stage to use an unfortunate pun but I want to come back to the developing information that I'm getting about the circumstances, there are still negotiations going on with EUFA to how this would work.
