Fiona Bruce [00:08:02] Select Committee, who do you think. 
Seema Malhotra [00:08:08] The numbers are clearly moving in the wrong direction. That’s across Scotland as well as England. My worry is that neither government are learning from the mistakes that were made very early on. The UK UK government, it seems to me, has lost control of the virus. They are losing confidence. They’re no longer following scientific advice. We have not seen Nicola Sturgeon come forward to follow the scientific advice that came through in the way that it did from SAGE. Under the SNP government you’ve already mentioned that we have the highest R rate in the UK. Both governments were far too slow in setting up test, track and isolate or test and protect. And my worry is with those businesses and livelihoods at stake now, if we don’t have a way that both governments are going to learn from what has gone wrong and be honest and open about it and work together more closely, we are going to go into a winter where it will be much more difficult for all of us. That is why Labour has called this week, as you know, for a two to three-week circuit break in line with SAGE advice.
