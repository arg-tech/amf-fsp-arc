AudienceMember 20210722QT08[0:05:42] Thank you, has hypocrisy, and about the closest thing I can say are Robert is I'm Welsh as well and that's about the level I can draw. On the news tonight, Welsh supporters have been turned away from Amsterdam airport, because they can't go and see the game in Amsterdam which is being played on Saturday night against Denmark, Denmark supporters can go. Welsh supporters can't go. Because Amsterdam decided that due to the variant in the UK they do not want Welsh supporters traveling there. It's hypocrisy that EUFA can come here from any country in the world yet we can't go as supporters to any other part of the world. Total hypocrisy.
