AudienceMember 20210819QT23[0:52:24] I'm not a football fan but I certainly celebrate any shift of power to the people. What shocked me was hearing the Prime Minister say that he understood that anger. Boris, doesn't he understand the anger behind the Me Too movement or even the anger over the Northern Ireland protocol? I am shocked that he didn't just blank it, disapprove of the violence.
