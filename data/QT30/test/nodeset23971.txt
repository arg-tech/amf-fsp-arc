There's lots of evidence that the nutritional value of food banks isn't the same. It's a small step in the right direction. It's almost a Public Health emergency in many cases.

Every little helps, and individuals have responsibility for the food they eat, and the choice they make, but I think it's important to consider the fact that for many people, more expensive healthier food might not be a direct option for them.
