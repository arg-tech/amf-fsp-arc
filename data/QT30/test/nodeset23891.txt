Fiona Bruce[0:09:26] Martin.AudienceMember 20210805QT03[0:09:28] I question whether or not animal welfare standards are below the EU's standards. Is that the Labour Party's position?Lucy Powell[0:09:38] We have high standards in this country so we've got nothing to fear from alignment with the EU. We've got those high standards and, in fact, it is the Government's ambition, I understand, to kind of raise those even higher. So I don't understand why we are so fearful of that when it is something that won't scupper a trade deal with the US and would enable the free-flowing movement of sausages and other goods.Fiona Bruce[0:10:02] Does that answer your question, Martin? Is this something, forgive me, Martin, I don't know if you voted for Brexit or against Brexit?AudienceMember 20210805QT04[0:10:10] I voted for Brexit.Fiona Bruce[0:10:12] Is this how you thought it would turn out in terms of Northern Ireland? Are you happy with what you see?AudienceMember 20210805QT05[0:10:22] Northern Ireland wasn't my biggest concern when I voted to leave the EU, but it is something that is becoming a bit of a dog's dinner. The Government really do need to get control over this, for all types of exports of Northern Ireland.
