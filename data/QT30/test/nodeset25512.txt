Fiona Bruce [00:46:24] Liam? 
Liam Halligan [00:46:26] We have a withdrawal agreement. What we are after now is a trading agreement. So we don’t trade on World Health Organisation terms. If we do, it will be low on some sectors, high on others. The money we don’t spend in Brussels, maybe the 10 billion a year can be spent on other areas. I think there will be. The EU has a trade deficit of almost £100 billion. That’s hundreds of thousands of jobs in Germany and France. So I think the European Union wants a deal. But I share the frustration because on the surface fishing is a small percentage of the economy. It is even smaller in France. Macron has a fight on his hands in the 2022 election, not just from Marie la Penn but fishermen and the north of France. Look at what we are considering here. I study the issue closely, it is always the Brits, represented by our own media, who are represented as being unreasonable.
