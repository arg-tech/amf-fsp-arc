Fiona Bruce[0:13:28] I'm going to take a question from Hannah.
AudienceMember 20210805QT08[0:13:32] Hi. With the exponential growth in case numbers in the north-west, should the country extend the lockdown, use local restrictions or unlock as planned?
Fiona Bruce[0:13:44] Well, as you say, Hannah, cases are growing in the north-west and growing much more slowly across the rest of the UK. Kavita, extend the lockdown, use local restrictions, unlock for all?
Kavita Oberoi[0:14:00] So, a number of prospectives. Right from the start, for business, obviously it has been really, really challenging from the start. In business, you have to be driven by the data. Any decision-making is always driven by data and statistics. And I think right throughout the Government hasn't been the best at managing and looking at the data, making those decisions and, you know, last week, we've had 7500 cases which has been the highest since March. Now, I know that we've got less hospitalisations, vaccinations are there.
Fiona Bruce[0:14:44] Do you think we should unlock on 21st June...
Kavita Oberoi[0:14:48] For the younger population, my concern, what my concern is, I've got a 21-year-old and I've got friends who have got 21-year-olds who have got long COVID, so for me, we should be careful about the restrictions. We should have localised restrictions, because we don't want to go into a full-blown lockdown again and I think we still have to think about health. Health is wealth. We've got to navigate through this.
