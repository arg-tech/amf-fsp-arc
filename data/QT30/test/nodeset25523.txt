FIONA BRUCE [00:34:54] If Matt doesn’t drop to the floor, frothing at the mouth sort of thing. 
MERRYN SOMERSET WEBB[00:35:02] It will show the population it is absolutely fine. 
MATT HANCOCK [00:35:04] I would take the vaccine as soon as I’m allowed to. We talked about -- 
FIONA BRUCE [00:35:10] What about taking it to encourage others? 
MATT HANCOCK [00:35:12] That’s a good question. Because I would be happy to do that. The problem is that would be putting me ahead of the queue in terms of clinical need. Now, because I work in the department for health I count, as it happens, as a healthcare worker. So if my taking it when healthcare workers are allowed to take it, so not jumping the queue, if that would persuade a single other person to take it and give confidence to others, then I’d be absolutely happy to. 
FIONA BRUCE [00:35:44] Should we do a totally unscientific straw poll. Put your hand up in the audience if you think Matt should be one of the first to take it. Quite a lot but not unanimous. Robin, I know because I have spoken to some of our audience members before we came on that quite a few are happy to take the vaccine as soon as they can get it. We heard from John to that effect. Some people are a little bit more worried about it.
