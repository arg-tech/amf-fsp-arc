AudienceMember 20210930QT09[0:17:50] What should the UK do to fill the estimated 100 thousand HGV vacancies and avoid empty shelves this Christmas.
Fiona Bruce[0:17:59] Well, Richard, I think you're probably the best qualified to take us through this to begin with.
Richard Walker[0:18:05] I don't know. Yes, HGV drivers, right, well, we as a company are about 100 short, as a nation we're about 100 thousand short, and we have a long term structural issue in this country in that we have an ageing population of HGV drivers around the average age of 57, so we desperately need to recruit new drivers, and of course that's the right things to do.
Fiona Bruce[0:18:36] And is the prospect of empty shelves or fewer things on shelves solely because of HGV drivers or are there other issues as well?
Richard Walker[0:18:42] No, I mean, it's coming at us from all angles at the moment. We have the C02 issue, we have HGV, we have a shortage of workers in factories and fields and processing plants. It's very difficult out there, and my staff have been nothing short of heroic, as have the HGV drivers in terms of keeping the wheels turning over the last 18 months, throughout the pandemic. We haven't closed a single store, we haven't missed a single delivery, but now we're having to do so, and we're missing up to 80 deliveries a day to our stores. This is a real issue that is now impacting the supply into our stores.
