Jonathan Ashworth[0:49:36] I think we have got to be aware that the Criminal Justice system has suffered swinging cuts over ten or 11 years, that's surely had an impact on these conviction rates and prosecution rates. I was looking at the data from the Home Office and the CPS, and the justice department Robert, I mean it is shocking! It is absolutely shocking. I mean like, over 5 2,000 rapes recorded by the police, and only 843 results in a charge or sumons, and 2102 positions and 1439 convictions, massive drops on previous years. So, the cuts have surely had an impact. I'm sure people appreciate the apology that you have made, but the test of that apology and whether that apology carries weight is what are you going to do to turn around this absolutely awful record? This record is on your watch Robert. I have not heard what you are going to do to sort this out?

Robert Buckland[0:50:36] Read the review.

Jonathan Ashworth[0:50:36] Tell us now.

Fiona Bruce[0:50:40] He has told us some of it. I need to get Kate in.

Kate Andrews[0:50:44] Look I think the Prime Minister's comments were clumsy but I think it would be a bad assessment to assume he was trying to make a direct link to the conversation that had been happening previously
