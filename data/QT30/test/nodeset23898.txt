[0:18:58] I think for me, I live in Manchester and my parents live in Liverpool. When we had the local lockdown in Manchester last time, my dad, who is a taxi driver, said the amount of people that he was picking up from Manchester was so high. So I feel as though going down the local lockdown approach, it is a sort of a false safety because a lot of people won't respect that and will just go somewhere else anyway. So all you end up doing is just spreading the COVID to other areas where maybe it is not as high. I feel as though, you know, we need to continue following the science and look at how it goes and then respect what the science tells us.

[0:19:42] I think easing the restrictions too quickly could cause us some catastrophic problems. We've got students who are going home from university very shortly. There will be a big movement of people across the country. I certainly feel very uneasy about going into a supermarket without wearing face masks. I will still continue to do so and you can't legislate for other people, and I think, whilst we have a variant on our hands which is demonstrating to be extremely contagious, I think we need to be very mindful of how we manage that. I don't think anybody would have an issue with continuing the restrictions we've currently got.
