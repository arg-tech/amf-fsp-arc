Deborah Frances-White[0:53:52] I understand how important football is to people. It really, really is. I'm not saying that the NHS and housing and schooling is as important as football because I don't want hate Tweets. But it is up there, surely. Wouldn't it be great if people were as engaged or more engaged about those things because it clearly works. The European super league died a death as far as I can make out on Twitter because the people didn't want it. What else could we ask for if we went to this government and said: We're not having it.

AudienceMember 20210819QT25[0:54:24] I think it is an interesting point for a Tory minister to make that there needs to be a shift in power yet there are other examples of where there needs to be a shift in power. How do you feel that is possibly when the rights of people being able to protest is being attacked?
Fiona Bruce[0:54:44] If I have time I'll come back to you on that.
