Yanis Varoufakis[0:36:54] I really don't understand what has got into Boris Johnson, by comparison to every other piece of expenditure in the Government. I can only explain this as some part by Boris Johnson's universe or Cabinet, to appeal to voters who always get excited by the thought of defunding bloody foreigners, but if I may say, Fiona, Gillian mentioned vaccinating the world. It is important to look at some very stark numbers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, in March 2020, the G7 central banks have printed $9,000 billion supporting the banking system, quantitative easing. 9,000 billion. The International Monetary Fund 3 weeks ago, estimated how much it would take to vaccinate humanity. Everyone with two doses of, you know, whatever it is, AstraZeneca, or Pfizer or whatever, the total sum came to something like 33 billion. 9,000 billion has already been printed. 33 billion would be enough to vaccinate the world. The G7 Central Bankers should do that tiny little thing that is necessary. A little blip in their, you know, printing presses would be sufficient to pay for the vaccination of the whole world without the taxpayers funding anything.
