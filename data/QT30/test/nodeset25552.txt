Marsha[00:45:10] I think…I mean, too many people…if you’re saying that a 15-year-old was stopped several times by the police and it was racial profiling, that doesn’t come from one specific police officer, that comes from the whole attitude of people in general…police officers in general. And they didn’t go to the police force with that attitude, I think that came from the way they were brought up or things that they’ve learned, you know, in their lives as they’ve grown up. I think if people had a different attitude towards black people as they grow up, it would start there.
Fiona Bruce[00:46:07] Okay, let’s…there’s lots of hands up, I’m going to try and get round as many of you as I can, sort of, reasonably briefly. Anthony?
Anthony[00:46:13] People don’t want another review, they want to see change. That’s why they’re on the streets, that’s why it’s brought them out on the streets to… Though, like you said, eight reviews and what has changed for them? All that I see is that there’s a lot of section of this nation getting disenfranchised with the whole scenario. They want to see change and there are things that can be done. You know, they could teach the children about black history in school, they can introduce culture…black culture and ethnic culture into the curriculum. It’s their country, people have got to be made to feel like it’s their country, but they’re not.
