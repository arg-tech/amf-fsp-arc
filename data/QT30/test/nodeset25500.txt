Fiona Bruce [00:48:46] Where does Labour stand in terms of a referendum on a united Ireland? 

Louise Haigh [00:48:50] First and foremost, as cosignatories to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, that is absolutely sacrosanct. That is for people of Northern Ireland to determine their own future. The Belfast Good Friday Agreement held that whatever your aspirations, whether to a united Ireland or to remain in the union, that it is in all our responsibilities to drive progress in the here and now. I think what I heard Lesle saying, that she wanted to see good government and good progress in the here and now and driving change for people in Northern Ireland. Mo Mowlam always said it was the real lives that needed changing. So I asked all of us the British government, the Northern Ireland executive and other guarantors to The Agreement in Republic of Ireland have a duty to secure that peace into the future. I know the last five years have frayed the bonds of the union and the Good Agreement. I would appeal to everyone who has a stake in Northern Irelandâ€™s future to rededicate themselves to final implementing that Good Friday Agreement
