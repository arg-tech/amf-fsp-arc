Women aren't going to have access to emergency contraception and all those things and, you know, we're going to have bigger implications, so you know, I think we can get through this.

AudienceMember 20210805QT16[0:33:50] I think it is shameful and unjustifiable to cut the amount of foreign aid. We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world and it is right that we give the largest amounts. The wealth that we have in this nation was, in large part, built through exploiting the human and natural resources of less economically developed countries. We should be helping them out at this awful time of the pandemic.
