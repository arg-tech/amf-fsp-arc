John Bercow[0:42:10] On this issue, I think Hugh is right and I think the sector deserves relief and support.
Robert Jenrick[0:42:18] One point of fact. The reason to stick to the dates that we've talked about and why that doesn't conflict with the data not dates point, is that it takes talks five weeks to gather the correct data so that you can make the most informed decision. That's the point that the minister, Chris Witty, our experts, review the data in the knowledge of all the facts, make a decision, then provide sufficient time for the sector to provide for whatever the outcome is. That is why it is better not to rush and make a decision before you're armed with all the information.
Fiona Bruce[0:42:50] Hugh.
Hugh Osmond[0:42:52] I'm afraid that's incorrect. Contrary to what was said earlier, we do have access for the data. The roadmap, the way out of lockdown, was based on three models, three principal models. The assumptions behind the models were published, I'm pleased to say. What we can actually see is that in all respects the data has consistently, from the end of January, been better than those models. For example, if we take vaccines themselves, which has been a tremendous achievement by the country, which is now being squandered, we can see the assumptions that we used in those models and we can see the uptake amongst the vulnerable was much greater than the models assumed.
