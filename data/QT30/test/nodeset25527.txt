FIONA BRUCE [00:54:14] Merryn. MERRYN SOMERSET WEBB[00:54:18] I just wanted to work on reassuring Rosie’s anxieties because I think we’re talking about the vaccine at great length which is interesting and exciting and I hope we’re at the beginning of the end of the whole thing but we’re not talking about the various treatments that have been coming along. While we wait for the vaccine to be rolled out and for everyone to get it there’s a cheap steroid that is working quite well, there’s a UK-based company that is in phase 2 trials on using a drug that is known to be very safe and cheap working in different illnesses that could work well for this and these clinical trials is shown to be. So it is not just about the vaccine; it is also about the fact that we know very good treatments are there, we know that death rates have been falling during the second wave compared to the first wave. We know the mortality rate as a whole is very low and we are learning more about how and where it transmits. I’ll sure we’ll get on whether lockdown is a good idea later, but we know you don’t get get Covid-19 when you’re out shopping. So we are learning we can live our lives whether the vaccine is rolled out or not.
