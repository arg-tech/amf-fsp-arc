Prompt Templates for Argument Relation Classification using Frame Semantic Parsing

Expected Input: one comprehensive xAIF file containing all information nodes and text segments

Functionality: first, this web service considers xAIF graph to first of all extract frame sematics in each I node, and then design prompt templates to classify argument relations between I nodes 

Expected Output: Two xAIF files which first one is extracted frames and their elements within each I node, and the second one is predicted argument relation between argument components
